<p class="ph1">ON THE ROAD WITH A CIRCUS</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />

<small>THE MODERN CIRCUS</small></h2></div>


<p>The faithful recording of daily life with one of
the &#8220;big shows,&#8221; wandering with it under all vicissitudes,
fortunate or adverse, is the errand on
which this book is sent. You and I will travel
from the distraction and tumult of the summer
season to the congenial quiet of winter quarters,
and survey operations from the hour when new
and unwonted scenes and sounds startle city quiet
or country seat retirement until the stealthy
breaking of the white encampment and the departure
from town. We will scrutinize the entrance
of strangers into strange lands and observe the
rising and expansion of the tents as an army of
men stamp their image upon the earth. Our
astonished eye will gaze upon the gorgeous pageant
of the parade and returning to the grounds
will peer freely and familiarly about the place of
strange sounds and entrancing sights. We will
watch the master mind of the circus and his associates
in counsel and action. We will study the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
life, character, and habits of the motley throng of
&#8220;show&#8221; people and learn of morals and manners,
of hopes and fears, of trials and solicitudes; and
we will pass sunny hours on meadows enamelled
with violets and daisies and goldened with buttercups
and dandelions, where the circus is passing
its day.</p>

<p>We circus people have so high an opinion of
our good qualities that we are not ashamed to
introduce ourselves to you. As pilgrims with no
abiding city, leading a life of multiplied activities
and varied fortunes amid scenes of din and turmoil,
hurry and agitation, our platform is courage,
ambition, and energy, governed by honest
purpose and tempered by humanity. We have our
infirmities, our faults, and our sins, but also our
virtues, our excellences, and our standards of perfection,
and a discerning world has come no longer
to regard us as unscrupulous invaders, but as
invited and welcome guests. The voice of joy and
health resounds through our ranks; we are united
in fraternal good-will unbroken by dissension, our
life of weal and woe is ever invested with peculiar
delightful fascination, and boisterous relish transports
itself from town to town. Memory clings
with fond tenacity to halcyon days with the circus.</p>

<p>Sometime between 1820 and 1830 (circus annals
tell not exactly the year), near what is now New
York City, while a red-coated band blew forth a
merry melody, a round-top tent swelled upward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
The parents of some of the present-day performers
remember the day. It was the first cloth circus
shelter erected in this country, and then what was
formerly an open-air show assumed the dignity
and importance of an under-cover performance.
A crude enough affair it was, as compared with
the perfection and finish of the modern circus.
The flags and streamers and bunting which add
grace and beauty waved no friendly greeting; the
clamorous welcome of side-show orators and ticket
sellers was wanting; no menagerie offered its accumulated
wealth of curious and snarling beasts;
human curiosity had not been awakened by the
overpowering splendor and magnificence of a preliminary
parade; there was a lack of sentiment
and excitement and appeal to the senses; only
din and confusion and broiling heat. From this
mean beginning has come the marvellous circus of
to-day, involving a business so extensive that few
people possess anything but the vaguest conception
of its magnitude, organization, and methods
of operation.</p>

<p>Underlying the pomp and glitter and the odor of
sawdust and naphtha is a system of government
and management whose scale and scope are stupendous
and staggering. No human institution is
more perfect in operation and direction. Surely
no more flattering tribute could be paid than that
officially given us by the United States Government.
Officers from the army department, skilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
veterans in their profession, critically observed the
swift sequence of proceedings when we showed in
Washington&mdash;the early arrival of the trains; the
rapid debarkation; the magical growth of the
white encampment; the parade passing with measured
tread through deeply lined streets; the scene
on the grounds and at the performances, and the
pulling down at night and the hurried, though
orderly, departure. Then Gen. Nelson A. Miles
surveyed the scene and expressed wonder and admiration.
Finally there came a request that two
representatives of the department be permitted
to accompany the circus for two weeks. To the
Government had come a realization that the
modern circus offered lessons in the transportation
and handling of men and horses, canvas and
vehicles. And when the Barnum &amp; Bailey Show
was in Europe, the monarch of one of the world-powers,
visiting under tents incognito, confessed
that he had profited immensely by what he had
witnessed, and proposed to put into immediate
effect many of the original working arrangements
of the circus. For instance, astonished at the ease
and celerity with which the heavy circus wagons
were run on to the cars by means of a block and
tackle and an inclined plane, he admitted, ruefully,
that in his vast army they had been hoisting their
artillery over the sides of the cars. It remained
for the American circus to bring appreciation of
the waste of time and labor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>So to the humble employee of the circus who
wanders with it from place to place, one day in
one town and the next perhaps one hundred miles
distant for a period of more than thirty weeks, is
a part of the strange daily life, witnesses the
emergencies constantly met and dealt with and the
perplexing obstacles overcome, comes a forcible
and convincing knowledge that it is not an ungodly
thing to be questioned and looked at
askance, but a genial, legitimate, business enterprise,
based upon sound principles and conducted
upon the highest lines of ability and responsibility
by men who assumed a risk at which the nerviest
professional gambler would hesitate. The amount
of capital invested is several million dollars; no
insurance company will give protection. The
dangers of the road are never absent. A cataclysm
of damage suits is a constant peril. Rainy
weather, preventing performance and profit, may
be a companion for months. There must be constant
renewal of costly perishable property.
Deaths of costly rare animals may swallow up
the receipts of days. Continual other dangers
and losses, of whose frequency, gravity, and magnitude
the general public has no adequate conception,
are encountered. Against these ruining
possibilities the circus stakes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is a popular misapprehension regarding
the profits of the circus business. Some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
large organizations have continued in existence
for periods of several years without returning a
cent on the investment or at an actual operating
loss. Less strongly financed tented shows succumb.
The circus is an infallible register of the
monetary condition of the country. Hard times
are reflected in it, and prosperity fills it with joyous
evidence. The daily expenses of our circus are
placed by the management at over $5,000, and a
moment&#8217;s calculation discloses that the receipt of
this amount of money is not the quick operation
surface conditions often indicate. The average daily
free admissions are eleven hundred. These are
largely the tickets given for bill-posting privileges.
This territory embraces, generally, forty miles on the
lines of all converging railroads and a distance of
twenty miles in both directions from the tracks.
City officials, newspapers, and a throng of others
claim the remaining gratuitous entrance passes.
Sometimes the number is larger. In one city we
have been obliged to place three thousand free
tickets.</p>

<p>Experienced circus owners reckon that one-quarter
of the attendance comprises children under
nine years of age and who pay half-rate, twenty-five
cents. Thus it will be seen that some thirteen
thousand persons, including those with free tickets,
must pass the door each day before a dollar&#8217;s
profit has been yielded from this source for the
management. Our &#8220;big top&#8217;s&#8221; capacity is ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
thousand persons. One realizes, after consideration
of these facts and figures, how necessary it
is that there be few vacant seats at either performance
to insure a profit for the day, and how
often the net revenue is supplied entirely by side-show,
peanuts, popcorn, lemonade, and other
small departments. Moreover, when the casual
observer convinces himself that the huge tent is
full to repletion, he is often badly mistaken. The
circus usher must perform his duty with great
care and systematic thoroughness, else he will permit
the man who has paid for one seat to occupy
two or more.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The circus does not run its season, dissolve, and
disperse. In winter the entire establishment is
maintained. Only the performers and workmen
are dropped, and with the former this is generally
a mere suspension of service, for contracts are
frequently made for several years. Owners, managers,
contracting agents, advertising agents,
press agents, treasurer, bookkeepers, and others,
find no idle moments. Rolling stock, suffering
from the hard effects of a season&#8217;s campaign,
needs painter and carpenter; new acts and novelties
must be secured to keep abreast of the times;
the new route must be laid out and considered;
and to do this the management must know the
population and character of every town; have
information of the condition of business, vicissitudes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of the year and the prospects for the coming
season; know the national, state, and municipal
law and the character of licenses, and the price
of food for man and beast; keep track of floods,
droughts, or disasters to crops or people; be conversant
with the periods of ploughing and harvesting;
learn what railroads run in and out of
town, their grades and condition, the extent,
strength, and height of tunnels and bridges and
the relative positions of railroad yards and the
show lot; and find out the condition of the soil
wherever the circus is booked in case of rain, and
provide in advance for such a contingency. The
circus is a fair-weather show and the management
must have a definite knowledge of wet and dry
seasons, to avoid encountering, so far as human
foresight is possible, unpropitious meteorological
conditions.</p>

<p>The question of transportation is the most
careful one involved, and upon its cost and facilities
the route of the circus is in a great measure
determined. For instance, up in agricultural
Windsor county, in southeastern Vermont, nestles
the village of White River Junction. It boasts a
weekly newspaper, a public school, and a national
and a savings bank. Its population does not
exceed fifteen hundred; yet the big circuses make
annual pilgrimages thither because it is a local
trade centre, the Boston and Maine, Central Vermont
and Woodstock railroads converge upon it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and there the White and Connecticut rivers merge
their waters. Its selection for exhibition purposes
is a good illustration of the important part transportation
facilities play in arranging routes.
White River Junction itself would not turn out
patrons enough to pay for the menagerie&#8217;s food,
but the throngs conveyed there by train and boat
always fill the tents. So it is all over the country,
barring the large cities. It is not so much
the character and size of the place picked for the
tents as its topographical position and drawing
powers.</p>

<p>All through the winter a corps of women is
busy on new uniforms and trappings for man,
woman, and beast. There are rich plush and gold
bullion galore in this workshop. The pretty spangles
that will glitter in the ring are being sewed in
place, the elephants are getting new jackets of
royal purple and gold, and the camels are being
fitted out afresh for the parade. Some of these
gorgeous fittings are very expensive, but the circus
management calculates that they must be renewed
every year. The outlay for hats, boots, and other
articles of attire for the army is heavy and ceaseless.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Circus day, to the men who have hundreds of
thousands of dollars invested, it will be seen,
means the culmination of long and careful and
systematic preparation. To get ready for the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
has been the work of many months and has employed
the talents and attention of men wonderfully
expert in their particular fields. The advance
staff of one of the &#8220;big shows&#8221; usually consists of
a general agent, a railway contractor, an executive
agent, several general contracting agents, and
assistants; car No. 1, carrying eighteen to twenty
persons; first regular advertising car No. 2, bearing
the chief press agent, car manager, and from twenty
to twenty-five men; car No. 3, with eighteen to
twenty men; car No. 4, carrying a special press
agent and car manager and from twelve to fourteen
men, including &#8220;route riders&#8221; and special ticket
agents; next and finally, the &#8220;layer-out,&#8221; who is
one day ahead of the circus.</p>

<p>The railroad contractor is the first man out.
He is familiar to the finest details with every railroad
in the country&mdash;its mileage, connections,
yard facilities, bridges and tunnels. He plans,
besides arranging for the transportation of the
circus trains, the special excursions which will
converge upon the town on the specified day of
exhibition. The general contracting agent follows.
He makes contracts for feed, lot, accommodations
for advance men, livery teams, and billboards.
The contracts of these two men involve
many thousands of dollars every week and must
pass the rigid scrutiny of the experienced general
agent. No detail of the business is unfamiliar to
him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>Car No. 1 is professionally known as the &#8220;skirmishing
car.&#8221; It is most frequently called into
service to fight opposition. As soon as a railway
contractor of a rival circus puts in an appearance
on the route the general manager is promptly
notified. There is at once a formidable concentration
of forces at the threatened point. No stone
is left unturned or chance overlooked to gain an
advantage; and the circus man is resourceful of
schemes and plots. Billboards, barns, fences,
hedges, trees, windows, and all other available
space is bought up with apparently reckless expenditures.
Banners, printed on muslin, are swung
from walls and awnings. Sometimes more money
than will be realized on show day is spent in this
fight for publicity, but the circus regrets not a
cent of it if the opposition has been taught a lesson
and will not venture again to cross the
path.</p>

<p>Attached to a passenger train and about four
weeks ahead of the show, comes car No. 2. The
general contracting press agent is aboard with
his advertising cuts and prepared advertising matter,
or keeping pace with it on the route. Sometimes
there is a steam calliope, which produces
marvellous sonorific effects at sundown, to the dismay
of all who live in the immediate neighborhood,
but calling obtrusive attention to the approach
of the circus. The force of men bills and
lithographs for miles around. Each team has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
native driver who knows every road and every
inhospitable bulldog. Permission is always secured
from the owner or lessee of the spot selected
for decoration, for without his consent, the
astute showman knows, a poster becomes soon a
thing of shreds and tatters. In return for the
privilege an order is given on the circus for
tickets, which is promptly honored if the agreement
has been honestly kept.</p>

<p>The men on two other cars see to it that the
work of their predecessors is followed up carefully.
Various neglected preliminary work is in their
charge. They replace posters torn down or mutilated
and try to find new points of advantage.
They check up and report every discrepancy of the
other advance men, too, and send a detailed report
to the general agent. The last man before
the arrival of the circus is the &#8220;layer-out&#8221; or
&#8220;twenty-four-hour man.&#8221; He inspects the lot,
fixes the route of the procession, and performs a
variety of other final duties.</p>

<p>Sometimes a stereopticon man is sent out, but
not unless there is opposition or the outlook for
the day&#8217;s business is bad. He stretches a big
white sheet on a popular corner and entertains
the town for an evening, adroitly advertising
the show and putting the people in good humor.</p>

<p>A general agent estimates for me that the score
of pretentious circuses employ, during at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
seven months of the year, an average of fifty bill-posters
each, making a total of six hundred men,
outside of agents, contractors, inspectors, etc. To
properly transport, supply, and provide for these
employees it requires not less than thirty-six advertising
cars, which, in the course of a season, cover
every part of the American continent and the better
part of Europe. These men post upward of one
hundred and seventy thousand sheets of paper
daily, and as their display of paper usually has a
thirty days&#8217; showing for each day&#8217;s exhibition, it
is safe to estimate that from five millions to five
millions two hundred thousand sheets are in sight
for six months of the year. To-day the public often
measures the value of an enterprise largely by
the size and character of its posters. The development
of poster printing and bill posting is due
largely to the demands of the circus. Not all the
commercial advertisers put together use posters
so liberally as do the combined circus interests.
The requirements of the circus built the boards
and the results obtained forced the business to
become a permanent and recognized factor in active
commercial life.</p>

<p>One big circus used in a season seventy-seven
kinds of posters, varying in size from one to
sixty sheets and let loose on the public twelve
publications, from a four-sheet to a twenty-page
courier. They had a total edition of five million
four hundred thousand copies.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>The elevated standard of morality among circus
men and women is a revelation to one who lives
with them from day to day and is their close
companion. The atmosphere and environment
seem charged with health and happiness, virtue
and vigor. Drunkenness is not tolerated in any
form. Immediate discharge, no matter who or
what the rank of the offender, is its penalty, and
except in isolated instances among the canvasmen
there is seldom provocation for punishment.
Of other vices which are prevalent in many walks
of life there is no evidence. The very nature of the
business, with its claims on brain and body, forbids
immoral or vicious excesses. Those who indulge
in them are looked upon with coldness by
their associates and made to feel themselves
delinquents. Gambling is strictly prohibited, and
fines are imposed upon the employee who is heard
using profane or vulgar language. The women of
the circus are not permitted even to engage in
conversation with any one not directly connected
with the show. Most of them spend a few hours
each Sunday in church. A fine awaits the luckless
man caught exchanging words with an outside
woman. It is the effort and aim of the management,
too, to inculcate a spirit of good-fellowship
and enduring affection, founded upon mutual respect
and esteem. It demands that all be obliging
and civil, answer questions politely, assist patrons
in distress, smooth ruffled tempers, in short, make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
people who go to the circus feel at home, have a
good time, and want to come again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Circus folk, like sailors, are perhaps the most
superstitious people in the world. They have
numerous curious beliefs and all possess pet
superstitions. Disease, disaster and death are
presaged in their minds by signs and wonders.
Few are without amulets and charms. Four-leafed
clovers, made as pendants in silver or glass, and
rabbits&#8217; feet set in silver are favorites to ward
off evil. Many have horseshoes nailed to their
trunks for luck. To see three white horses in succession
and no red-headed woman is a forerunner
of good luck. So, too, they declare, is the sight of
a boxed corpse in a railroad station as the train
rolls in. It is an ill omen to catch a glimpse of
the death receptacle when leaving a town. Tapping
a hunchback on his hump is sure to result
favorably, and a white speck showing on the
finger nail indicates auspicious things. The appearance
of a white foamy spot on the surface of
a cup of coffee or tea denotes &#8220;money,&#8221; and
should be at once swallowed intact. To open an
umbrella in a house is sure to result in a shower
of trouble, and one&#8217;s future is risked by going
under a ladder. Breaking a mirror is significant
of death and seven years&#8217; ill-luck. If undergarments
are put on wrong side out, it is tempting
fate to change them until removed for the night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
A peacock&#8217;s presence is fraught with promise of
dire evil, and a stuffed bird or a fan of its feathers
bodes ill for the owner. To eat while a bell is
tolling for a funeral will bring misfortune. The
hooting of owls at night is ominous of death.
Bad luck may be expected if a mouse gnaws a
gown. To rock an empty cradle will entail injury
to the child who should occupy it. Salt spilt at
the table is a warning of a quarrel, unless a pinch
of the mineral is promptly thrown over the right
shoulder. Stray cats have their terrors, but a
black one is welcome.</p>

<p>Many performers invariably go into the ring
putting the right foot forward. If they neglect to
do this they back out and re-enter. All believe a
cross-eyed man should never be permitted inside,
the tents; evil times accompany him. Few foreigners
fail to cross themselves before performing,
and nearly all wear strange charms. Many circus
people regard a color or a combination of colors
as a hoodoo. None would venture to cross a
funeral, and I have seen those who turn their
backs until a death procession has passed out of
sight and hearing. All believe Friday an unlucky
day, and are sure there are fortunate and
unfortunate hours in every day. If Friday falls
on the thirteenth day of a month, it will bring
misfortune, for thirteen cuts a wide swath in the
profession.</p>

<p>In marked contrast to the popular notions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the rank and file of circus men is the practice of
Mr. James A. Bailey, who founds his business
conduct along lines tending to discourage superstition.
Friday is his accepted choice upon which
to make an important move&mdash;the Barnum &amp;
Bailey show left America on Friday&mdash;and he welcomes
the figure 13 in any transaction. His
marvellously successful career perplexes credulous
associates.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The slang and colloquialisms of the circus form
a secret language in themselves, a collection of
jargon, racy, pungent, and pregnant of meaning,
and always used in familiar conversation. &#8220;Stall,&#8221;
as noun or verb, is a popular and widely employed
expression. It indicates anything tending
to conceal real intention, a confederate who diverts
attention, an accomplice under cover. For
instance, &#8220;I am stalling for a walkaway,&#8221; if I
refrain from notifying a customer that he has
forgotten his change. The &#8220;walkaway,&#8221; a flurried,
absent-minded, or hurrying person who leaves
his return money behind, is legion and a constant
source of joy to the ticket-seller. &#8220;Nix&#8221; is a
significant circus watchword, whose utterance generally
is the signal announcing the approach
of some one in authority or who is not a confidant.
It is used, too, as the curt form of request
to desist from word or deed. The exhibition
place is never anything but a &#8220;lot&#8221; in circus parlance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and the organization itself is referred to as
the &#8220;show.&#8221; A &#8220;snack-stand&#8221; is the improvised
structure at railroad depot or show ground where
a hasty bite of food can be obtained. The men
who sell candy, popcorn, lemonade and the like
are &#8220;butchers.&#8221; The tents are &#8220;tops&#8221; in the circus
vocabulary. The canvas under which the performance
is given is known as the &#8220;big top,&#8221; the
eating tent as the &#8220;cook top,&#8221; and so on. One
might travel a season with a circus and not hear
the word tent mentioned. The side-show is the &#8220;kid
show,&#8221; as the vernacular of the profession has it.</p>

<p>Employees are &#8220;working&#8221; whether driving stakes,
throwing somersaults, or sitting on exhibition as
a curiosity. The broad license of the word is
amusing to the stranger who hears the Albino,
whose sole occupation is to receive the stares of
side-show visitors, remark that &#8220;she didn&#8217;t work
yesterday,&#8221; but remained in the car all day. The
rallying-cry, &#8220;Hey Rube!&#8221; has become a vague
memory among modern circuses. Ample police
protection is assured nowadays, the character of
circus employees is higher and the discipline is
sterner, and the days of sanguinary encounters
among themselves or with town rowdies are gone
forever. The inaugural procession around the
tent is the circus man&#8217;s &#8220;tournament.&#8221; A &#8220;grafting&#8221;
show is the circus with dishonest motives, as
described in another chapter, and its &#8220;fixer&#8221; or
&#8220;squarer&#8221; is the man who makes the corrupt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
arrangement with town officials. In circus dialect
&#8220;yap&#8221; and &#8220;simp&#8221; indicate a credulous rustic
who is easy prey for sharpers.</p>

<p>The policeman in plain clothes is rather contemptuously
referred to as a &#8220;flattie.&#8221; A trunk is
known as a &#8220;keester&#8221; and a valise as a &#8220;turkey.&#8221;
Circus dialect for a man is always &#8220;guy,&#8221; and the
proprietor of the show is invariably styled &#8220;the
main guy,&#8221; or the &#8220;main squeeze.&#8221; The former
appellation is probably adapted from the fact
that the main guy rope holds the tent in position.
To &#8220;fan a guy&#8221; is to make an examination to
discover whether or not he is carrying concealed
weapons. A pocketbook is a &#8220;leather,&#8221; a watch
a &#8220;super,&#8221; and a watch chain a &#8220;slang.&#8221; &#8220;Lid&#8221;
signifies a hat and a ticket is called a &#8220;fake.&#8221; A
complimentary ticket or a railroad pass has no
other name than &#8220;brod.&#8221; An elephant in circus
language is never anything except a
&#8220;bull.&#8221; The showman&#8217;s word for peanuts is
&#8220;redhots,&#8221; and their lemonade concomitant is
designated &#8220;juice.&#8221; &#8220;Plain juice&#8221; is water. Human
eyes are &#8220;lamps,&#8221; and heads are chosen
&#8220;nuts.&#8221;</p>

<p>The posters and lithographs sent out in advance
are &#8220;paper,&#8221; and the programmes and other literature
are distinguished as &#8220;soft stuff.&#8221; Side-show
orators have the cognomens &#8220;spielers&#8221; and
&#8220;blowers,&#8221; and the employee who has charge of
the naphtha torches, which are &#8220;beacons&#8221; in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
circus world, is known as the &#8220;chandelier man.&#8221;
Reserved seats are alluded to as &#8220;reserved,&#8221; and
all other allotted sitting space is termed &#8220;the
blues,&#8221; derived from the painted color of the
boards. Clowns are &#8220;joys&#8221; and the other performers
&#8220;kinkers.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The history of the circus records many disasters
by fire, wind, and wreck, but only a few solitary
instances in which patrons have suffered. In none
of the vocations of life, in times of crisis, are
given better examples of energy, daring, discipline,
and power of command and obedience. For more
than a score of years, since the old method of
overland horse and wagon mode of transportation
was abandoned for the swift, modern steam-engine
way, hardly a year has failed to catalogue
a catastrophe entailing loss of life and property
and human and animal misery. Yet death and
damage are confined to the ranks of the show
people.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_024f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">CIRCUS ENCAMPMENT AT EARLY DAWN.</p>

<p>Railroads are notoriously indifferent to the interests
of the long, heavy circus trains in their
temporary keeping. Accidents in transit are frequent.
A misplaced switch, confusion in running
schedules, a careless engineer or trainman, may
bring impoverishing adversity. The circus is never
exempt from peril, when planted for the day
in apparent security, when journeying from town
to town or when housed in wood or brick. Misfortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
follows, too, even to winter quarters,
where, perhaps, general impression assumes to the
circus owner freedom from care and apprehension.
There are many things conspiring to make him
old before his time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Southern States generally yield good profits,
but the crowds are more disorderly, often, than in
any other section of the country. Guns protrude
from many pockets and their owners are eager
for a chance to brandish or discharge them. Inflamed
by whiskey, these circus visitors are a constant
menace to life and property. It is only by
an exercise of great diplomacy that we escape
frequent trouble. Mississippi is greatly accredited
among showmen with being the most dangerous
State in the Union, as is the police force of Philadelphia
called the most efficient for their purposes.
The New York bluecoats are called upon for little
display of their ability and organization with the
circus established in the stone and wood of Madison
Square Garden. Municipal officers throughout
the South have the reputation, whether justified
or not, of being past grand masters in the subtle
art of &#8220;shake-down,&#8221; the circus man&#8217;s parlance
for palpably unfair means of extracting money.
Extortionate fees are levied for all privileges, and
in many cities hordes of professional damage
seekers await a pretense of excuse for demanding
money.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>In one city, for instance, the owner of the land
on which we exhibited gave plain directions as
to its area and they were abided by. At eleven
o&#8217;clock, when all the preliminary work of the day
had been performed, his neighbor rushed to the
lot and demanded four hundred dollars; his property,
a worthless patch of rocky soil, had been
encroached upon six feet by one end of the &#8220;big
top!&#8221; It was a frank attempt at extortion and
the native nursed the conviction that the circus
was powerless to do aught but pay. Little did he
imagine the resourceful energy of the showman in
a crisis! Under the owner&#8217;s personal supervision,
the big reaches of canvas were levelled again,
while the landholder stood by in amazement. At
noon, an hour and a half after the unreasonable
demand, the circus had moved itself the required
distance and taught the Southerner a lesson he
will not forget.</p>

<p>The incident is an example of the deliberate
purpose of many persons to take unfair advantage
of the circus and illustrates how completely their
nefarious plans sometimes go awry.</p>

<p>Trouble came unceasing that same day. The
crowd was ugly and seeking fight, and some of its
members even invaded the rings and insulted performers.
We were told that night that ours was
the only circus that ever left town without undergoing
the annoyance of having the side ropes cut,
a playful prank of the place. On the night journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
from lot to cars, the hippopotamus cage
tipped over and was righted with great difficulty,
while the huge inmate roared his fright and disapproval.
Later, the big vehicle conveying the
side-show paraphernalia collapsed near the same
spot and made more work and delay, and filled
the roughs with glee at our plight. The colored
&#8220;snack stand&#8221; proprietors, who, of course, are no
part of the show, were robbed of their proceeds
by native thieves, amid great wailing, and a colored
man was killed by the cars in the confusion
at the loading place. The circus men were the
only witnesses to rush to him in the hope of giving
relief. Never were men, women, and children
happier over a change of scene than when our
trains moved to new environments.</p>

<p>During the night run, a desperate attempt was
made to rob the money wagon. Two men were
busily working with brace and bit and hammer
and saw, when the watchman, patrolling his lonely
beat along the line of cars, came upon them.
They jumped from the slow-moving train and
escaped in the darkness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The well-organized circus seldom misses a performance.
Rain and mud are its enemies, but
their combined endeavors only infrequently prevent
erection of tents, and the parade and exhibition
which then infallibly follow. There are instances
in which the elements have upset plans for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
two or three successive days, but conditions are
seldom so unkind. Shovel and pickaxe and beds
of absorbing straw accomplish wonders. If denied
the opportunity to erect the &#8220;big top,&#8221; sometimes
the show is given in the less expansive
menagerie tent and the animal cages are kept on
the cars. The enforced arrangement is unsatisfactory
to circus man and patron, but to the
former it gives the consolation that the day will
not be entirely without receipts.</p>

<p>The recuperative powers of the circus are marvellous.
Many a show which has been almost entirely
exterminated by a railroad wreck or other
disaster has within a few weeks again taken up
the thread of dates. The reason for this quick
restoration is that duplicates of almost every
necessity can be obtained. A hurry call brings a
new tent to replace the damaged one. Men who
make a business of supplying circus menageries
with animals ship a great new variety at once,
and in an incredibly short time the renewed show
is on the move once more.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />

<small>ARRIVAL AND DEBARKATION</small></h2></div>


<p>Through the gloom of night and the dusk of
early morning the heavy circus train labors on its
journey to transient destination. The distance
diminishes slowly. Sometimes the line of cars is
shunted to one side and stands patient and inert
while expresses clatter by; again, its dragging
weight defies the straining efforts of the engine,
and it is left in solitary helplessness while the
iron horse scurries off for aid; often the cars are
rattled together with body-racking violence. Farmers
in the barnyards rub their eyes in mute
astonishment at the moving spectacle, and cattle
scamper from fright. Other trains are in hot pursuit.
Their burden, too, is man and beast and
varied showy paraphernalia. Four or five sections
are required to transport the vast and
wondrous effects of the circus.</p>

<p>A quiet, unpretending village has already begun
to assume an air of stir and animation. Festal
circus day is at hand. Parents and children line
the railroad approach and eagerly seize upon all
points of vantage. Keen curiosity and joyful anticipation
are depicted on every face. The railroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
yards are empty of rolling stock, and switchmen
and engines are ready to receive and admit the
travelling pageant and pilot it to a place convenient
to its needs. No preparatory arrangement
that human foresight can conceive has been neglected.</p>

<p>The intuitive welcoming shouts of boys and
girls, a blurred slender outline in the distance, the
screeching of railway whistles and the hurried
orders of officials. Then a pressure of brakes, a
crunching of wheels and a rattle of coupling pins.
The circus has arrived!</p>

<p>One of the first to alight is the circus mail-carrier,
who hurries off to the post-office. Important
mail may await his coming and there must be no
delay in its delivery. This is the first of three
trips to the government station he will make that
day, and between these journeys, which are frequently
long and tedious, he will perform a variety
of other work allotted to him at the lot. He
knows by name every employee of the show, and
his prompt and accurate service is rewarded at the
close of each season with a purse of contributed
money which invariably approaches a thousand
dollars. At his heels is the general manager
whose multifarious duties require early rising.
The circus detective follows behind, scrutinizing
faces and figures, conferring with railroad officials
and approaching by easy stages the local police
station. There are two sleeping-cars carrying performers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and business staff on the first section. A
great brushing of clothes and final completion
of toilet, performed generally on the car platforms,
precede their departure from the railroad
yards.</p>

<p>The first section is known as the &#8220;baggage
train.&#8221; It bears the paraphernalia necessary to
the immediate wants of the encampment, as follows:
stake and chain wagons, canvas wagons,
side-pole and centre-pole wagons, side-show wagon,
stable wagons, water-tank wagons, cook-tent and
blacksmith wagons, chandelier wagon, about two
hundred draft horses, all dressing-room necessities
except the trunks, the two performers&#8217; and business
staff&#8217;s sleeping-cars and the cars of most of
the workingmen and their horses.</p>

<p>In the second train are jack wagon, the tableaux
wagons, the elephants and camels and their keepers,
performing, ring and baggage horses, seat and
stringer wagons, &#8220;property&#8221; wagons, and all the
appliances for performers and their baggage. The
third and other sections carry more sleeping-cars
and all the cages.</p>

<p>Twenty-two horses are allotted to each stock
car. There are animals of all kinds and colors
and sizes, from the saucy ponies and fleet, slender
chariot beasts to the big, white ring and the
heavily harnessed draft horses. The circus carries
close to half a thousand of these equines. They
are so loaded that they must needs stand erect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
during the journey, for injury and perhaps death,
experience has taught, is the inevitable result of
one of the brutes disposing himself, by accident
or design, in any other position. The packing of
them so close together that the possibility of this
disaster is precluded is a duty delegated to the
&#8220;wedge horse&#8221; of each car. After every other animal
has taken his accustomed place at night and
when to the lay observer they are as tightly compressed
as safety demands, the trained &#8220;wedge
horse&#8221; scampers up the inclined plane and burrows
his way between the two animals in the
centre of the car. He shoves and pushes until he
is accommodated, and not until then is the boss
hostler satisfied that there will be no accident.
Although it would appear that they are crowded
to unnecessary extreme, the circus man understands
that the compression in reality renders the
railroad trip more comfortable, for the wrenches
and jars incidental to the journey have far less
deleterious effect upon them than would be the
case if they were loosely loaded.</p>

<p>Each driver has his team of two, four, six,
eight, or ten horses and he makes two trips to the
exhibition ground. Each wagon has its number,
and each day and night the same man and beasts
have it in charge. The drivers seem to have an
intuitive knowledge of topography. Often the lot
is several miles distant from the place of arrival
and unloading, but these men of the reins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
are never confused as to locality or direction.
They make the most complicated journeys without
hesitation or mistake, seldom resorting to
interrogating the native residents. Roads curve
and wind in a manner most bewildering, but
they keep steadily toward the scene of exhibition.
These rides through pretty suburban streets in the
gray light of the morning are often very delightful
and invigorating. Generally, sidewalks are
lined and porches packed with people eager to get
their first glance of the circus, though its beauty
and grandeur are hid. Frequently the trains are
shifted during the day, and night, with its blackness,
finds the circus cars awaiting their loads
in an entirely different section of the town. The
drivers are informed of the change, but it is left
to their keen perceptions to make the trip by the
shortest route. This is no simple accomplishment,
in the gloom of streets and with landmarks entirely
unfamiliar, but it is performed without
blunder or inaccuracy. The number of accidents
to man and beast in these nocturnal wanderings
is remarkably insignificant, due, in a great measure,
to the skill of the reinsmen and their coolness
in emergencies. Sometimes steep hills, rough
roads, or sharp corners bring disaster, but not
frequently. The wagons progress to their destination
behind four-, six-, eight-, and ten-horse teams
as smoothly, safely, and swiftly as the local doctor
goes his rounds.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>The money wagon is early off the train and on
its way to the lot. Inside is the assistant treasurer
of the show, who has been shuffled about
continually during the time allotted to slumber,
but whom long service has inured to the racking.
He is there to guard that part of the coin and
bills which has not been expressed to New York.
There is not an instance on record of a successful
attempt to loot the money wagon of a circus, although
many showmen wonder that the apparently
inviting opportunity offered has not been
seized. This immunity, I suppose, rests on the
basis of knowledge that there are no more courageous,
determined fighters than circus employees.
For daring, hardihood, and bodily prowess they
have no superiors. The boldest highwayman may,
well hesitate before he takes liberties with the
money wagon. He would find a man inside ready
and experienced in gun play, and a party of circus
workmen whose duty it is to be prepared for
invaders would appear like men from the ground.
If the marauder escaped with his life, much less
the plunder he sought, the prediction often made
would be inexact.</p>

<p>Arrived at the lot, the money wagon is a scene
of stir and activity. The press agent is there to
receive the money for newspaper advertising.
Then all the bookkeeping which the circus demands
in great variety must be accomplished,
for the morning is the only period of the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
which gives opportunity for the work. Later the
sale of tickets and the balancing of accounts
engrosses all time and attention. Pay day comes
each week to every employee of the circus. The
performers are paid on Saturday during the time
between the afternoon and evening performances.
On Wednesdays, during the afternoon show, the
long line of workmen forms and several hours are
consumed in the exchange of money. The operation
is laborious, for sometimes the coming and
leaving of the men is frequent. Each has a name
and number for identification assurance, and the
two men who make the payments are thoroughly
exhausted when the operation is over.</p>

<p>The owner&#8217;s private car is attached to the last
section, a position which makes it certain that
the owner be on the scene if there is accident
to the other sections. In case of breakdown or
other railroad misfortune, his section would speedily
overtake and he would thus be soon in personal
command. The sections usually halt at
the given point within a half hour of one another,
and soon the last employee has stumbled
over ties and rails toward the lot and all the
wagons have departed from the scene. Long
lines of empty cars await the repeated activity of
night. These cars, incidentally, are as extended
as safety and convenience permit, for railroad
companies charge for transportation by the single
car. The fewer cars drawn from town to town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the smaller the amount of money the circus is
called upon to pay.</p>

<p>It is easy to distinguish the performer from his
fellow employee as the men leave the cars. The
acrobats and gymnasts limp down the car steps
as if every bone and muscle were lame and sore,
and progress with halting tread toward the lot,
very different in aspect from the firm, elastic-stepped
men who entered the place the night before.
It is an unhappy condition in which every
one of the athletes finds himself the morning after
the violent exercise of the ring or bar. None of
them takes any unusual precaution to guard
against physical affliction, and the wonder is that
often they are not more seriously handicapped
after sleep. After a few preliminary exercises their
sound, strong, vigorous constitutions assert
themselves and they are ready and eager for any
required feat.</p>

<p>The veteran circus man is superficially acquainted
with the physical features of most of the
towns visited. Alighting from the car, he surveys
the landscape and heads straight for the lot. He
has been there before and he recalls it all. Here a
sleeping car was burned two years ago; in another
town two elephants had a thrilling duel to the
death; there is the jail where a ticket taker was
locked up without just cause; &#8220;Mr. Lew&#8221; remembers
the bank where he secured bonds when a man
with a claim for damages attached the ring horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
with the mistaken notion that he would be bought
off for a large sum of money; through that low
bridge a heavy pole wagon once crashed. Every
place in the country is associated with some personal
incident in the circus man&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p>I walk often to the lot with a gray-haired man
whose form is unbent by age, whose eye is undimmed,
and whose active manner still evinces
readiness to plan and will to execute. He is one
of the ringmasters and has other duties of the
arena and the business office. He has dwelt his
long life in circus precincts, and for him the whole
circus fraternity cherishes a peculiar veneration.
Honesty and godliness mark his career, and his is
the example pointed out to the circus young. Well
may they imitate his virtues and walk in his footsteps!
His presence recalls the faint memory of
overland journey and one ring, and the stern hardships
of the days of long ago. Those were times
when his name was familiar wherever the show
tent penetrated, and when his exploits made him
the marvel of the profession and the prominent
feature of performances&mdash;for none in all the world
could equal his feats of horsemanship and acrobatic
skill. From the haunch of the white circus
beast he executed revolutions which even the modern
show has not duplicated, and aloft he tumbled
and turned in dare-devil accomplishments which
now only the reassuring stretches of the net concede.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>Simple modesty characterized his life of spectacular
success, and now, when time has forbidden
active participation and a new generation has
entered upon the stage, he accepts with cheerful
philosophy his relegation, to a uniform which bespeaks
only the cracking of a whip. His wife,
many years his junior, is one of the conspicuous
performers, for he has taught her all the finish
and art of bareback riding, and made her one of
the cleverest wire-walkers with the show. He is
always at her side when she performs, advising,
correcting, praising, and, as she elicits admiring
gaze, few in the audience recognize his figure as
the one in whom so much sentimental interest
centres. The press agent, extolling the youth and
beauty and grace of the performer, points him
out casually to the reporters as her &#8220;father&#8221; and
flatters himself that he is subserving the interests
of the show; but if the woman knew of the tale
she would promptly put a stop to its circulation.
She is proud of her kindly old husband and wants
the world to know it. She boasts no circus pedigree,
as do most of her comrades, and was
schooled in the circus arena after she had reached
her majority. She is a living refutation of the
tradition that one must be born to the ring.</p>

<p>We watch her rehearsals in the spring with
curiosity, and the other performers always profit
by the directions and advice the veteran gives her.
Sometimes, to his practised mind, she is awkward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
and slow of comprehension. Then I have seen him
jump to his feet and leap to the horse&#8217;s back. He
forgets his forbidding age, in the emotions of the
past, and would fain give her the benefit of a
demonstration. But his feet have lost their inspiration,
his hold is unsteady and his muscles
do not respond. He alights rather shamefacedly.
The young athletes pat him kindly on the back
and cheer him with words of his former glory;
and his wife puts her arms around his neck and
says he&#8217;s a dear old fellow. Love and loyalty will
be his enduring memorial.</p>

<p>The inherent energy of the circus is never more
fully demonstrated than when there is tardiness in
arriving at the town of exhibition. The fault is
seldom the circus&#8217;s and generally the railroad&#8217;s.
Connections have been faulty, the engines inadequate
to the requirements of the heavy trains,
facilities for loading bad, or there has been delay
in ferrying the sections. There are no faint hearts
or falterers with the show and no weakness in
these crises. Out of confusion worse confounded,
order and convenience speedily reassert themselves,
and the tremendous amount of preparation for the
exhibition is rushed to wonderfully quick completion.
Sometimes it has been nearly noon before
we were able to drag a single wagon from the
cars, but the programme for the day has been
followed as implicitly as though there had been
no hindrances. The parade emerged with customary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
roar and glare, the performance followed in
regular sequence, and left behind was the same
satisfactory trail of desolated pockets that the
usual early coming would have accomplished.</p>

<p>Sunday is the circus man&#8217;s day of rest and relaxation.
After the pitching of the menagerie and
the smaller tents, necessary to the accommodation
to the animals, the day is granted for freedom
and enjoyment. The start from the Saturday
stand is always made the same night, and the
Sabbath respite is improved for long railroad
runs. The route is so planned in advance that on
no one night except Saturday is the journey so
long that, everything favorable, there will be
tardy arrival. It is not deemed expedient to risk
a longer &#8220;jump&#8221; than eighty or ninety miles unless
transportation facilities are unusually advantageous.
The trips of one hundred and fifty
or two hundred miles are reserved for the night
which precedes the day of exemption. So it is
that the circus folk, ending their slumber, find the
train still on the move, with a possible prospect
of several more hours in their cramped quarters.
The sagacious ones have examined the railroad
schedule the day before and laid in a supply of
fruit and food for this contingency. They preconceive
how sorely taxed will be the resources of
the train restaurant, for circus appetites are voracious
in the morning. Chairs are soon placed on
platforms and at windows, and the workingmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
gather in groups on car tops or under the ample
spread of the wagons.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_040f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">DISEMBARKING FROM THE CIRCUS TRAIN.</p>

<p>These Sunday morning railroad pilgrimages
carry the circus through all climates and localities
and, unless too protracted, afford a sense of keen
enjoyment. There are inviting expanses of woodland
and water, moor and mountain. Summer
verdure clothes the scenery, and the view is often
entrancingly beautiful to the crowd-surfeited vagrants.
Smiling villages and beautiful cities pass
in procession. The gazing native is bombarded
with interrogations as to the proximity of the
circus train&#8217;s ephemeral goal. Sometimes there
are brief stops at wayside stations, while the engine
takes water or gives place to another iron
hauler. Then occurs an exodus from the cars.
Men, women and children improve the opportunity
to exercise their cramped bodies, for nothing is
more distasteful to their active persons than restricted
movement, or to invade with hurried dash
the humble railroad restaurant. Never before has
its composure been so rudely disturbed. Coffee is
gulped down eager throats, and the return to the
train is made with hands and pockets overflowing
with sandwiches. Two sharp warning shrieks from
the engine and the start is made anew.</p>

<p>Few of the performers or staff members go to
the lot for Sunday meals, although the tent
awaits their presence. They register at the local
hotels and spend much time in writing and reading.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Many take advantage of the chance for a
change and spend the night away from their accustomed
sleeping apartments. In the evening a
large number of the women attend church and the
men pass a few hours in simple pleasures. At the
lot the scene is one of peace and quiet. The canvas
of the &#8220;big&#8221; and other &#8220;tops&#8221; which have
not been elevated lie passive on the ground ready
for the men who will haul them aloft at sunrise.
They are not raised until immediate necessity
demands, for the reason that the danger of
fire or &#8220;blow down&#8221; is thus minimized in the
one and rendered impossible in the other instance.
Curious crowds flock about the grounds
and are permitted free scrutiny. It is particularly
a Sunday assembling-place for women. They desert
household cares and domestic duties for the
fascinations which invest the circus in repose.</p>

CHAPTER III<br />

<small>EARLY SCENES ON THE LOT</small></h2></div>


<p>The selection of the place of exhibition is a duty
which requires careful study and practical observation
and involves a variety of considerations.
Ten acres is the smallest piece of ground on which
our circus can spread itself, and an unoccupied
site of this size which has the requisite advantages
is not always easy to find in these days of rapid-growing
communities. A plot which had all the
conditions demanded the year before may be the
foundation of many houses when the show arrives
on its next visit. The spot chosen is generally
rural in its situation&mdash;the claim on space makes
this unavoidable&mdash;but it imperatively must be
urban in convenience. Swift-moving trolley cars
have added joy to the circus business, for they
make accessible these remote localities. Obviously
when transportation facilities are awkward, the
show suffers. And so it is that usually we find
ourselves settled for the day where stretches of
electric wires are a constant menace to towering
chariots and a source of terror to their fair occupants.
Of course, the conformation of the immediate
ground and the condition of the soil are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
taken into important account in the choice of the
lot, but the difficulties which they offer often submit
to the mastery of the army of workmen.
Water must be convenient, abundant and wholesome.</p>

<p>Sometimes nowhere in a town can be found
empty room for all the big and small tents,
huddle them as we will. Then the &#8220;big,&#8221; menagerie
and side-show &#8220;tops&#8221; are given places in
the allotted limit, and the canvas adjuncts are
planted down the road, in neighboring back yards
or in distant fields. It is an irritating and inconvenient
compromise, but one that cannot be
always avoided. These annoying conditions, however,
do not present themselves as a general rule.
Our destination is more often a fragrant spacious
pasture where the air is pure, the sun brilliant
and nature&#8217;s tranquil beauty all-pervading.</p>

<p>The boss canvasman is first on the ground and
remains in supreme control of the horde of brawny
men who trail after him. With the arrival of the
chain-and-stake wagon the active work of erecting
the tents begins. The &#8220;cook tent&#8221; is first placed
in position, for food must await the throngs of
men, women and children who are on the way.
This is a simple and expeditiously accomplished
duty, as compared with the elevation of the &#8220;big
top,&#8221; a swelling fabric within whose folds fifteen
thousand persons can accommodate themselves.
The boss canvasman combines with other qualifications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
a practical knowledge of surveying. His
comprehensive scrutiny of the area determines
accurately boundaries, positions, extent, lines and
angles, and indicates to his experienced mind how
best to avoid roughness and depressions and how
to overcome the other resistances the tract offers.
Sometimes huge rocks or spreading trees make the
task one of great difficulty, for it must be accomplished
with haste. His examination finished, he
unwinds a metal tape line and traverses the lot.
Slender iron rods are planted where he indicates.
These are immediately replaced by strong wooden
stakes to which the &#8220;guys&#8221; or ropes of the tents
will be fastened. Soon the ground bristles with
these pegs, thrust into place with unerring aim
and in perfect cadence by gangs of sledge-hammer
drivers.</p>

<p>Teams of horses pull the towering centre poles
into upright position and the skeleton of the
monster is in place. The vast reaches of canvas
are unrolled in sections and laced together while
flat on the ground. Then the mammoth white
cloth rises like a canvas-backed Aladdin&#8217;s palace
and is attached to the side-poles, which are twelve
feet high and twelve feet apart around the outer
edges of the white spread. The scene is one of
bustle and activity. Small boys are pressed into
service, receiving a ticket to the show as remuneration.
Menagerie, side-show, stable, blacksmith,
harness, dressing, wardrobe, and barber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
tents yield to diligent exertion, and soon the delegated
proprietors of the broad green space have
finished their morning labors. Meanwhile the
wagons and apparatus have arrived, and owner,
manager, riders, ringmasters, animal trainers,
gymnasts, jugglers, clowns, ticket-sellers and all
the rest of the heterogeneous throng put in appearance.
Curious crowds rivet their attention
upon the unwonted doings. They come from
farm and merchandise and from seats of learning
and courts of justice, and find keen enjoyment in
the sights and sounds.</p>

<p>The &#8220;cook tent&#8221; is one of the marvels of the
modern circus. It was the custom for many years
for the circus management to send its employees to
the local hotels for their food. The undertaking
of providing meals for the army on the grounds
was so stupendous that the most comprehensive
and well-organized show hesitated to make the
essay. Finally, the objections to the old method
made the accomplishment imperative. As circuses
grew in size, the combined resources of the hotels
in many towns were unable to meet the demand
made upon them. There was too much delay and
unsatisfactory provisions, and the circus felt their
injurious effects. The arrangement now in vogue
does away with all these difficulties. Advance men
see that all the needs of the commissary department
are provided for, and meat, vegetables,
water and the other requirements await the hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of the chefs. There are two separate and distinct
culinary establishments. One is occupied by the
workingmen, whose stomachs are not gratified
until the tents are raised and all the apparatus is
on the lot. This is a wise provision which insures
prompt work. There are no laggards in their
ranks in the early morning.</p>

<p>Under an adjoining canvas are fed the executive
staff and performers, men, women and children.
There are three long rows of tables, and crossing
them at one end a shorter set of boards where is the
owner&#8217;s place and those of his immediate
associates. It is from this position, his abundant
family collected around him, that he
makes his announcements, administers rebukes
and extends praise. He surveys the scene critically
and is immensely pleased at the healthy
relish which pervades the place. Curious sightseers
peer through the apertures and he abruptly
bids them retreat with the assurance that &#8220;we
are not wild animals. We eat just like other
human beings.&#8221; Outside the tent rest hogsheads,
from which are dipped panfuls of pure, clear
water, for grimy hands and dusty faces. Long
towels slung over stretches of rope are ready for
use. Scrupulously clean cloths cover the table,
and no spot or stain afflicts the dishes. The food,
cooked in the open, has its own peculiarly delicious,
appetizing flavor. It is served in abundance,
and a happier, heartier party never did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
justice to a meal. Skilful waiters do prompt,
experienced attendance. Service and quality could
not be improved upon in the large hotels of many
cities. As the &#8220;cook tents&#8221; are the first to be
raised, so they are the first to be levelled and
packed away on the cars. The last meal of the
day is served at five o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, and
two hours later there is no perceptible trace of the
improvised restaurant, save the coals which glow
in the twilight.</p>

<p>The harness and blacksmith tents are as complete
in their facilities as any stationary establishments.
In the former, waxed thread, needle and
hammer are busy through the day. The showy
equine accoutrements and trappings require constant
care, and among the tangled mass of collars,
traces, saddles, reins and other framework of
straps there is always labor of repair. The blast-furnace
of the blacksmith blazes from morning
until night, and his anvil knows no rest. There
are horses to be shod, iron pieces to be forged,
wagons needing attention, and a variety of work
which must be done with dispatch and thoroughness.</p>

<p>Across the field in a shady and sheltered spot
the ashen cloth of the circus barber shop shows.
No detail of a well-equipped city shop is missing.
Even is seen the pole, striped red and white spirally,
denoting the presence of the profession.
Here the men of the circus are shaved and have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
their beards trimmed and their hair cut and
dressed with great expedition and much perfume.
It is a time-saving convenience.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_048f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">CIRCUS COOKS PREPARING BREAKFAST.</p>

<p>The whir of sewing machines is never absent
from the wardrobe tent, and seamstresses work
with needle and thread from light to dark. Wear
and weather work sad havoc with resplendent
uniforms and trappings of human and brute, and
the need of repair or replenishment is always
pressing.</p>

<p>Cages are thrust under the menagerie tent only
long enough for the feeding of the animals, and a
hasty burnishing of gilt and cleaning of wagon
wheel and body. Horses reappear soon, now
plumed and ornamented, and drivers don the uniform
of the parade. This tent, like its big canvas
companion, will be empty and silent, save for the
arranging of apparatus, until the parade returns
from its formal journey to town.</p>

<p>In the stable tents the Shetland ponies delight
the children and command the admiration of the
elders. They come from the wild and sterile
islands between the Atlantic Ocean and the North
Sea, where they run at large. They are very
hardy, and their strength is great in proportion
to their size. Rough hair covers them, and their
manes and forelocks are large and shaggy. Very
useful in active, sure-footed work, and very valuable
to the show from an artistic standpoint, are
these small breeds of horses, but also are they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
very vicious and tricky. They bite and kick at
small or no provocation, at keepers and strangers
alike, and frequently engage in violent combat
among themselves. They are the subjects of
eternal espionage, but human vigilance cannot
always thwart their mischief. The dun or tan
color, with a black stripe along the back, is
prevalent among their shades, and they compose
one of the prettiest scenes on the circus lot. The
tricks they perform in the ring always meet enthusiastic
favor.</p>

<p>In the Southern States, &#8220;snack stands&#8221; line the
limits of the circus lot. Colored people conduct
them, and the food they provide is wholesome and
wonderful in variety. No Northerner who has not
witnessed circus day in the old Confederate section
has any adequate conception of the extent to
which these eating places flourish. The appetizing
odor of food pervades the air, patrons are filled
with the exuberance of the occasion, and the scene
is one to add a measure to the joy of living. No
dish often has a price exceeding five cents, and the
ham and chicken and cakes and biscuits served
have a peculiar charm of flavor, which sometimes
even lures the showman from the canopied canvas
of the &#8220;cook tent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Applicants to join the circus come by the score
in every town. There are few changes in the
ranks, however, during the season, except in the
cases of canvasmen and hostlers. These desert,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
are discharged or find other places frequently.
After a spell of rainy weather, never more wearing
on man and beast than with the circus, the less
stout-hearted or robust leave rapidly for easier
work. All the performers contract for the season
or longer, and are philosophic and satisfied at all
times. Sometimes the eager candidate for circus
honors is awaiting us at the railroad station, follows
to the lot, and often no rebuff or decided
denial of his demand for a position will suffice.
This persistent person we turn over to the head
clown and watch the cure. He is escorted with
great deference to the dressing-room, received by
the performers with keen anticipatory delight and
ostentatiously welcomed to their ranks. It is explained
that he must begin his career as a laugh-provoker.
His hair is filled with powdered sawdust,
he is daubed with chalk and dye-stuffs, put
in tights and ordered to the ring. There the ringmaster,
prepared to do his part, awaits him. The
luckless victim feels the sharp lash of the whip on
his almost naked legs, and is put through a
course of sprouts which finally drives him from
the arena, a sorry fun-producing specimen. Desire
for sawdust and spangles has left him.</p>

<p>An awkward problem which sometimes presents
itself is the replenishing of the horse stables. No
stauncher troupe of draft horses can be found anywhere
than the circus carries. Great strength is
a prime requisite, but they must needs be handsome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
handy and gentle. These qualifications are
not frequently grouped in one animal. So it is
that great care is lavished upon the circus equine
that his condition remain all that is necessary.
Despite all attention of the practised men of the
stables, however, sickness and accidents often send
the beasts to the stock farm or the graveyard.
Facilities for their treatment in wet weather are
inadequate, notwithstanding an expert veterinary
always is in attendance upon them, and is on the
regular pay roll. The strain of sleeping in a
moving train of cars at night and heavy hauling
at day is tremendous, and strange, rough roads
invite misfortune. Ailing animals cannot be transported,
and replacing begins.</p>

<p>At the outset of the season we were in particularly
bad straits. A rainy night when we first
paraded, in New York, caused an epidemic of pneumonia,
which our proficient veterinarian could not
stay. The supply of horses diminished rapidly,
and in two weeks it was with some difficulty that
we accomplished unloading, parade and departure
without serious delay. Then were displayed, conspicuously,
on the phalanx of stable tents and at
the entrance to the lot, announcements that we
desired to purchase native animals. The show
was then in West Virginia. For a fortnight the
scene in the horse quarters resembled a gypsy
camp. The owner and his associates knew just
what they wanted, made the fact plain and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
ready to pay spot cash when they found it. But
the farmers and horse traders at once conceived
the notion that this was a heaven-sent opportunity
to rid their stalls of the aged, infirm beasts
which had accumulated on their hands. Concealing
defects with adroit craft, they would flourish
up to tents and with great gravity of manner
dwell upon the merits of the animal which fitted
him perfectly for circus requirements. They reckoned
not upon the familiar knowledge of the men
with whom they dealt. A keen glance or a practised
touch revealed all blemishes. No trick or
stratagem, and I am sure every one known to
sharp equine transactions was employed, availed
against the showman&#8217;s discernment. A favorite
dodge was to exhibit the animal in the
shadow of the naphtha torches at night, but
exposure followed at once. The circus traversed
three States before the proper horses were procured.</p>

<p>Meanwhile &#8220;Boscow&#8221; unremittingly consumes
snakes in a gaudy canvas booth at the entrance
to the grounds. Clyde, a man of long established
integrity and not deficient in lungs, gives personal
assurances of the progress of the reptilian feast.
&#8220;Eighteen years old, not married, pretty; and
eats snakes like you eat strawberry short-cake!
Eats &#8217;em alive! Bites their heads off!&#8221; is his
frequently repeated promise, and the constant,
eager procession passing his stand and into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
ophidian enclosure, testifies to the weight of his
forceful eloquence.</p>

<p>Squatting in a cavernous serpentarium, patrons
find &#8220;Boscow,&#8221; feminine in appearance only because
of long, coarse black hair, surrounded by coiling,
crawling reptiles. &#8220;She&#8221; has presumably just
completed an especially elaborate animal meal, for
to the nostrils comes the breath of tobacco and
upwards winds the suspicion of cigar smoke. But
&#8220;Boscow&#8221; waves away the muttered insinuations
which penetrate even into &#8220;her&#8221; wild, untutored
mind, and at the word of command eats ravenously
of the amphibian mass which surrounds
&#8220;her&#8221; on all sides.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boscow&#8221; was captured in the far-off jungles of
Africa, Harry, the lecturer explains, and in wonderful
words he continues of &#8220;her&#8221; fight for liberty,
the ineffectual efforts to tame &#8220;her&#8221; savage
nature, and &#8220;her&#8221; sullen refusal to discontinue
snake diet. It is very awesome and impressive,
and the audience, before making way for the
clamoring ones behind, look with renewed interest
at the strange creature. &#8220;Her&#8221; appearance lends
belief to the fluent narrative, and to the more
shrinking ones is proof of the need of precautionary
measures in the dismal clanking of heavy
binding chains as &#8220;she&#8221; springs scowling about
the compartment. Little wonder no credence is
placed in the bold assertion of one who proclaims
that he saw &#8220;Boscow&#8217;s&#8221; brother, or surely a near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
blood relative, perspiring freely as he helped in the
erection of the booth that morning. Her kin are,
of course, in a remote, uncivilized land, and as
ferocious as the girl herself. The incredulous person
saunters off with dim wonder at the remarkable
likeness filling his mind, Clyde&#8217;s frantic invitation
to go inside pours out tirelessly, and Harry
paints again and again the glowing picture of the
snake-eating wonder.</p>

<p class="caption">TWO HEN&#8217;S EGGS, HAMMER, FILE AND NAIL-CLAW<br /> PRESENTED A PLEADING, PENNILESS
MISSISSIPPI<br /> NEGRO BOY TO SECURE ADMISSION. HE GOT IN.</p>

<p>There is nothing like a spell of rainy weather to
breed a feeling of despair in the showman. The
route has been planned with the idea of evading
as far as human foresight permits, unfavorable
meteorological conditions, but it is inevitable that
sometimes rain and mud and wind be encountered.
There can then be nothing more mournful and disheartening
than life with the circus. If, for a brief
succession of days, performances have to be abandoned,
profits are consumed with a ruining rapidity.
It is not infrequent that this form of misfortune
bankrupts the scantily-financed circus
which has started out with hopeful prospects, for
the overwhelming expense of maintaining the
organization is not reduced whether it remains
huddled on the cars or is displaying its glories to
lucrative crowds. So resolute and so prepared for
exigencies are the bigger shows, however, that
nothing less than a flood can prevent unloading
and presenting some sort of an exhibition. If the
rain is continuous, there is no immediate prospect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of relief, and the lot is a quagmire, the animal
cages are often left on the cars. A staggering
march to the marsh is made by the other vehicles
and a semblance of show is given in the menagerie
tent. In the space usually allotted to the animals,
seats are put in position and a gallant effort
made to get some financial return. A doleful,
drenching sight it is, horses wallowing in the ring,
acrobats and gymnasts shivering and slipping,
and clowns feebly trying to call to life the smile of
pleasure. Straw is littered over the premises in
the endeavor to absorb the moisture, but avails
little. Where the stretches of canvas are sewed together
the water penetrates through, and muttering
spectators leave reluctantly or elevate umbrellas.
The heavy laboring of the groaning tent
adds to the feeling of misery and melancholy.
The circus people gaze longingly across the empty
fields where are houses snug and tight. Then the
heaped-up gloom of the night, the black, wet
journey to the cars and a possible awakening to
identical conditions in the morning. These are
times that strain the buoyant temperament and
the rugged constitution. Sunshine, however, restores
human spirits, tarnished gilt and saturated
canvas, and drives away the ghastly memory of it
all. Exuberance reasserts itself and the panoplied
colony emerges in all its former order, convenience
and beauty.</p>

<p>It is the first heavy rainfall of the season that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
brings the most overwhelming woe. The custom
of circus owners is to wash their tents with paraffine
at the beginning of each season. The waxy
mixture renders the cloth waterproof and preserves
it from atmospheric influences. The treatment
is not efficacious, however, until the fabric
has been thoroughly soaked with rain and succeeding
sunshine has dried it out. So it is that a
dull dread of approaching calamity fills every professional
heart when the initial storm sets in. The
water falls upon showman and patron as if no so-called
protection was above. A wan and spectral
&#8220;big top&#8221; it is at night, sometimes with vivid
lightning filling it with sulphur-smelling blazes,
and the frail dressing-room tent clinging to it
like a luminous bulb.</p>

CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>THE PARADE</small></h2></div>


<p>Breakfast over, active preparations are on
for the parade. Well-fed horses and ponies in
shining harness and waving plumes take their
places before glittering vehicles; the sound of
music is heard from bands perched hazardously
high; clowns, charioteers, jockeys, Roman riders
join the line; camels and elephants, some bearing
a weight of feminine beauty in Oriental costume,
make appearance, and a picturesque cavalcade
nearly a mile long is in motion.</p>

<p>One of the managers leads the line down to
town and back. He has already been over the
course once, noting its conditions with caution
born of long experience. Sometimes his foresight
bids him change the route. A corner is too sharp
for the forty-horse team, a hill may be dangerously
steep, a bridge too low or unsafe, the road
too rough, or perhaps the advance man did not
appreciate that at a certain point the parade
would &#8220;double&#8221; on itself.</p>

<p>Behind him a drum corps blows and beats, and
then Jeanne d&#8217;Arc, in polished armor, with clanking
curtains of chain mail. The flush of tan is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
beginning to tint ears and cheeks under her helmet
and her two mounted knights are very happy
and proud. She is a young woman who was
adopted by a wealthy aunt in Pittsburg, who sent
her to Europe to keep her from entering circus
life. Her sudden return, romantic marriage with
a tattooed man, enlistment as a jockey rider in
Cedar Rapids, Ia., and rapid rise to the front
ranks of equestriennes is a matter circus folk
never tire of discussing.</p>

<p>Through densely crowded streets the procession
measures its gaudy passage, a handsome lovelorn
young acrobat yearning for the return to the tent,
where an eighteen-year-old girl somersault rider
eagerly awaits him; the stepmother behind, who
doesn&#8217;t approve of their devotion; a uniformed
marshal, whose thoughts are for his wife, seriously
ill in a Philadelphia hospital; a brother
who fears for his sister; a bicycle rider at the
performance, now high on the back of an elephant
whose temper has been bad for several days; Sultan,
a majestic lion, viewing it all calmly from the
top of a high cage; bands playing, horses prancing,
wagons rumbling, calliope screaming, clowns
frollicking&mdash;truly a fantastic panorama. And
sometimes ahead, then behind, again on the side,
a tramp bicyclist, darting up steps and down,
scaling fences, into stores and houses, often one
wheel off the ground, seldom on both, but never
dismounting.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>By the side of the band wagons and behind the
shrieking calliope a cloud of boys keeps tireless
pace, reeling off mile after mile, but gorged with
happiness. Street cars make time with the procession,
jammed with passengers and scores hanging
to platforms, paying no fares but this eloquent
testimony to the passing show. The tigers
and lions look bored, and the hyena yawns with
accumulated ennui. Behind, the gorgeously caparisoned
riders, men and women in tights and
spangles and breastplates of shining gold and
steel; behind, the richly-decked camels with riders
from the great desert and the elephants swaying
to and fro with monotonous tread, and near the
end of the gaudy line, the fairy outfit of Santa
Claus, the old woman of nursery fame, Bluebeard
in decapitation attitude and the other
tableau wagons of burnished gold and flaming
red.</p>

<p>The clowns are very much in evidence. Behind
all manner of steeds, from the camel treading like
a dusty spectre with his cushioned feet, to the
proud pony, and from the four-horse teams to the
decrepit agricultural equine; on foot and on elephant
and on bicycle; in costume weird and wonderful,
they are an amusement-affording part of
the cortege. Boys flock by their sides, and their
ready wit is equal to all exigencies. Well has the
press agent written:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">Clowns uproarious all the time,</div>
<div class="verse">Clowns and more than you ever saw,</div>
<div class="verse">Clowns that make the world haw-haw.</div>
</div></div>

<p>The clowns&#8217; band is near the end. In grotesque
attire, the &#8220;musicians&#8221; blow and beat on the top
of one of the chariots. The production is what
the alliterator of the show calls &#8220;a slaughter of
symphonies, a murder of melodies, a wrecking of
waltzes, a massacre of marches, a strangling of
songs, a total of terrific tonal tragedies!&#8221;</p>

<p>The inevitable hay wagon is in the column, and
nimble acrobats toss lightly on its fresh-mown
burden. Their costumes are bucolic throughout,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
but offer no impediment to their agile movements.
Country boys look on and marvel. The clown in
dilapidated wagon behind tottering horse is not
absent. His countryman disguise is so perfect
that his identity is not suspected. He narrowly
escapes being run down by the big circus wagons;
he is always in the way and impeding the smooth
progress of the parade; he becomes involved in all
sorts of plights, but emerges unscathed. It furnishes
great fun for the spectators. Sometimes
policemen threaten and oftener take him in custody.
Then he tells who he is and the crowd
roars again, this time at the bluecoat&#8217;s expense.
Hilarity reigns wherever is his presence.</p>

<p>Above the shrill tones of the fife and the blast
of the cornet and the clamor of drums and cymbals,
rises the oft-repeated admonition, &#8220;Look
out for your horses, the elephants are right behind!&#8221;
A clarion-voiced equestrian rides up and
down the line of bespangled magnificence with this
warning to those who view the spectacle in wagon
or saddle. A quick, keen, trained glance reveals
to him the probable effect the &#8220;led&#8221; animals will
have on each equine within eye and scent. He
knows, too, what the man who holds the reins
is not aware of, that the animal with the hump
alarms horses more than his ponderous companion.
Often the parade is brought to a standstill
while this precautionary person insists that a
horse displaying the initial signs of disquiet be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
removed to a place of safety, or, while with the
skill of long practice he assists in subduing a
beast whom the distant approach of the procession
has already alarmed. Women are his <i>bte
noir</i>. They have full faith in their horsemanship,
they tell him, and, anyway, their horses have been
thoroughly trained and broken. Then he is gently
but firmly obdurate, accepts with good grace the
denunciation to which he is subjected, but sees
that the possibility of disaster has been removed
before he permits the line to pass. He is a saver
of life and limb whose services few but showmen
appreciate.</p>

<p>Once the tents are pitched, no weather can be
so unpropitious as to thwart the parade. Rain
may fall in copious measurement; mud, perhaps,
is deep to the knees. But on with the parade! A
much weather-beaten and woe-begone lot of performers,
to be sure, and a drenched and blinking
lot of drivers, but all forgotten when the sunshine
comes again. This display is what circus folk call
a &#8220;wet day&#8221; parade. Women and children are
excused, much of the finery is kept in the shelter
of the tents, men wear mackintoshes and rubber
boots, and protecting canvas hides the gilt and
glory of the chariots. It has been advertised as
&#8220;positive,&#8221; however, and the management must
keep faith with the public or lose its confidence.
Then, too, it serves to show some of the glory
and fame of the organization, whets public curiosity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and the possible return of clear skies will
draw to the grounds the multitude which, without
its promise, would have returned home for the
day. Business instinct bids there be a parade
without fail.</p>

<p>Down in the town the press agent is paying the
newspaper bills for advertising, distributing tickets,
and seeing to it that editors and reporters
are put in good humor, and arranging as far as it
is in his power that notices before and after the
performances are complimentary. Sometimes he
accompanies a body of reporters to an advantageous
position and they survey the parade together.
He buys cigars and refreshment&mdash;at the
circus&#8217;s expense&mdash;and impresses his companions as
being affable, courteous and a good fellow generally.
They part company on fine terms of friendship,
and he assures them that he will consider it
a personal affront if they don&#8217;t all come to the
show and bring their friends. Sometimes his hospitality
has been so affecting that they will be
tempted to write pretty things about him; that
the &#8220;genial press agent&#8221; is with the circus, or,
&#8220;the circus is fortunate to have so efficient an employee&#8221;
and, following a description of his virtues.
But his prudence begs them to desist, for he knows
&#8220;the boss&#8221; doesn&#8217;t approve. The owner takes the
view that newspaper space devoted to the circus
itself is more to pecuniary advantage than an
enumeration of the qualities of the press agent.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>The keen eye of the general manager follows the
parade on its tortuous journey. If there be accident
or delay, or any other unforeseen trouble, he
is at the scene promptly and takes command. A
two-seated carriage follows the line. In it he, the
press agent, and the circus detective are conveyed
back to the lot. It is a convenience which dispenses
with a hot, dusty walk or an uncomfortable
journey in packed trolley cars.</p>

<p>The &#8220;$10,000 Beauty&#8221; was a parade feature of
one of the big circuses for several years. The
owner, a man deep in many schemes for advertising
his tented organization, boldly asserted that
he paid that amount of salary to a young woman
who proceeded through the streets striving to live
up to her reputation for grace and charm, on the
back of one of the largest elephants. She wore a
pained and anxious look as she clutched grimly to
the animal&#8217;s canopied hide, and there was little
appeal to aesthetic nature. Later she exhibited
her harmonious proportions in the menagerie
tent. She is now embellishing the variety stage,
whence she emerged upon the circus world, and
where, perhaps, her costly beauty is better appreciated.</p>

<p>Many will remember the telescopic affair which
P. T. Barnum exhibited in his parades for several
seasons in the early &#8217;70&#8217;s. It was a massively
carved chariot, and he called it the &#8220;Temple of
Juno.&#8221; When extended to its full height, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
means of internal machinery, it reached an altitude
of forty feet. A gorgeous effect was given it
by the precious metals which studded it and by
numerous mirrors. Upon an elevated seat, just
beneath a rich and unique oriental canopy of the
most elaborate finish, sat, in perfect nonchalance,
the representative queen, surrounded by gods and
goddesses in mythical costume. Elephants, camels
and dromedaries completed the tableau. During
that period of his career, a season of great prosperity,
Mr. Barnum used frequently to lecture on
temperance in his tents. He was shrewd enough
to appreciate how much to his pecuniary advantage
was his devotion to what he called the
&#8220;noble cause.&#8221; Crowds came as much to get a
glimpse at him and to hear him talk as for a
sight at the circus.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">
CHAPTER V<br />

<small>THE SIDE-SHOW</small></h2></div>


<p>Order has come out of the confusion at the lot
when the parade returns. All is in readiness for
the performances, seats and stands and rings and
trapezes in place, and every man at his post.
The cages are dragged from the parade to the
menagerie tent, the horses led to their canvas
stables, and elephants push the red and gilt vehicles
into place. Down drops the sidewall, ropes
are set, and the preparation is complete.</p>

<p>Stolid yokels fill the enclosure in front. Two
men are proclaiming with fluency and skill and
oratorical effect the wonders of the side-show, and
a row of huge banners adds weight to their discourse.
Pictured by word and brush are the
wild man, the midget, the Egyptian giant, the
woman ventriloquist, the knife throwers, the fortune
tellers, the electric lady, the snake charmer,
the others who make up the collection of oddities,
and the group of negro jubilee singers. The band
thumps seductively inside and frequently, as an
evidence of good faith, one of the freaks is called
to the front for a moment&#8217;s survey. Doubts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
vanish and the crowd hesitates no longer, when
suddenly as the <i>pice de resistance</i> is brandished
aloft, impaled on a slender iron rod, a raw hunk of
beef. It is to be the wild man&#8217;s dinner!</p>

<p>By far the most interesting specimen in our side-show
is this wild man. His history is long and
eventful. The side-show lecturer tells it vividly,
many times a day, and invariably the same when
he is not in a facetious mood. The narrative,
however, is always thrilling, never commonplace.
A curtain shrouds the interior of the cage in which
the creature &#8220;lives and subsists in a state of
nature.&#8221; Pulled aside, it reveals a gloomy den,
half filled with hay, where crouches, clawed and
tusked, and scantily clad in skins, the rude savage.
The fleeting and obscure view of the monster
afforded is amply satisfying to the timid,
and the venturesome see the curtain drawn, impressed.
A discharged employee in a spirit of
malice spread a tale of unexpected exposures. The
fellow asserted that once the wild man was eagerly
&#8220;shooting craps&#8221; with a colored canvasman, and
a second time had hastily torn a clay pipe from
his mouth and become again a weird, uncivilized
being. The manager was very indignant over the
infamous recital; and that very evening came a
full exoneration. The wild man escaped. (Business
had been unsatisfactory for several days.)</p>

<p>The alarm was sounded throughout the town
and spread terror. We all said we feared the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
worst. Armed men were sent in pursuit. The
fugitive was captured in a forest back of the lot
and returned, shrieking, biting and fighting fiercely,
to his den. Order was restored and the circus
turned away a thousand persons for lack of room
at the evening&#8217;s performance. The side-show was
not empty of visitors for a month afterwards.</p>

<p>We retain the services of our wild man with
some difficulty. His wife, a very indiscreet colored
woman from Vermont, has a pernicious habit of
appearing inopportunely and accusing our black
prize of gambling away his wages and not providing
for the support of his family. She is ample of
form, emphatic in manner, and prodigal of words,
and when she begins to bellow and boister, side-show
proceedings stop abruptly and the overwhelmed
orator hangs his diminished head and
yields verbal supremacy. It is not until she receives
from the management positive assurance
of a cash advance that she can be persuaded to
retreat. At these times the wild man is a very
meek and subdued person, and no amount of
urging will lure him from the security of his cage
until his wife is well out of town.</p>

<p>The original circus wild man, the denizen of
Borneo, was white, but his successors have almost
invariably had dark skins. &#8220;Waino&#8221; and &#8220;Plutano,&#8221;
exhibited together, are now before the
public. &#8220;Tom&#8221; and &#8220;Hattie,&#8221; wild children from
Australia, are dead. &#8220;Wild Rose&#8221; and &#8220;Wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Minnie&#8221; are still in the field of savage honor, as
is &#8220;Old Zip, the What-is-it?&#8221; whose head is cone-shaped,
and who utters mournful guttural sounds.</p>

<p>The life of the professional wild man is an unhappy
one at best. The story is told of a Baltimore,
Md., colored man, who, finding himself penniless
in Berlin, Germany, enlisted as an untamed
arrival from Africa with a small American circus
then playing abroad. He endured the torture he
was compelled to undergo for a month and then
stole away to a hospital. He was required to
explain how and why he came there.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, boss,&#8221; he observed sadly, &#8220;I&#8217;se been
working here, got ten dollars a week to play wild
man. I was all stripped &#8217;cept around the middle
and wore a claw necklace; had to make out as if
I couldn&#8217;t talk. &#8217;Twas mighty tiresome to howl
and grin all day. Then times got hard. I had to
eat raw meat and drink blood. The circus man,
he stood off as if he was afraid of me and chucked
meat on the floor to me. I had to lean over,
pick it up in my teeth and worry it like I was a
dog. It was horse meat and pretty tough, boss,
but it brought crowds for a while. Then it got
drefful cold for a nigger with no clothes on and
they put a snake around my neck. I couldn&#8217;t
stand that, so I&#8217;se come to the hospital.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was given clothes and medical treatment,
which he sorely needed, and a kindly American
sent him back to Maryland.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>Calvin Bird, a negro who hailed from Pearson,
Ga., was a famous wild man for several years
with divers small circuses, and toured most of the
country, mystifying all who saw him and sending
them away impressed with a conviction that he
was all he was represented to be. Not until he
appeared at a Syracuse hospital with a request
that his horns be removed was the secret of his
unnatural appearance disclosed. Under his scalp
was found inserted a silver plate, in which stood
two standards. Into these, when he was on exhibition,
Bird screwed two goat horns. Thousands
of people had paid admission to see the curved
bone projections and hear him bark. The artificial
additions were the idea of a physician in
Central America who gave the man an anaesthetic
and inserted the plate. The operation of
removing the support was a simple one and Bird
started for home from Syracuse with a normal
head a few days later. The wild man business had
got monotonous, he said, and anyway, he had
made enough money out of his deception to maintain
him in idleness for a long time.</p>

<p>The &#8220;electric lady&#8221; is one of the phenomena of
our side-show, and a source of great wonder to the
gullible visitor. She is saturated with the mysterious
force. A continuous supply passes from her
finger tips to whoever touches her flesh. Scoffers
are confounded at the manifestation, and there is
a general feeling among the side-show sightseers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
that she is a supernatural being. There is nothing
indicating a violation of natural law in the lady&#8217;s
appearance, and nobody appears to enjoy the
curiosity she excites more than her own merry
self. A strange feature of the exercise of the invisible
agent is that it generates only for commercial
purposes. For instance, the power leaves
her when the performance closes for the night, and
does not develop again until she is on exhibition
the following day. Then, too, the current confines
itself to a fixed spot. It passes away instantaneously
if she moves from her chair.</p>

<p>The &#8220;electric lady&#8221; in private life is a very
domestic and studious person. She is Mrs. E. N.
Willis, whose husband is one of the managers of
the tent and a recognized authority on &#8220;freaks.&#8221;
When I asked her for a contribution to the story
of the side-show she took pencil and paper and
evolved the following product. It was done under
the circus canvas on a hot September afternoon
in Illinois, while country visitors stared in wonder
at the sight of the &#8220;freak&#8221; in the act of composition
and thought. It is attached in the exact
phraseology in which it was handed to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;So much has been written regarding circus life
as seen only in the &#8216;Big Show,&#8217; it will not come
amiss to chat a while with a member of the side-show
fraternity. When the parade returns to the
show grounds, it is followed by a large crowd of
people, who have been invited by men with megaphone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
voices to witness a series of free exhibitions
which are used as a means of getting the people
together for the opening of the side-show, which
is the attraction until the &#8216;Big Show&#8217; is ready to
admit its visitors at one p.m. The side-show presents
a most attractive appearance to the rural
visitor, showing as it does upon huge banners the
many wonderful sights to be seen within.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a means of collecting the followers, a platform
is erected directly in front of the side-show
entrance. In showmen&#8217;s parlance it is known as a
&#8216;bally-hoo stage,&#8217; where, as promised the multitude,
these free exhibitions are given.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fearing that there may be a few stragglers or
sweethearts who have failed to keep up with the
procession, and wishing to give them all an equal
chance, the band is called outside, and with great
strength plays its loudest and swiftest selections.
Then the principal orator mounts the &#8216;bally-hoo
stage,&#8217; and striking upon a huge triangle enjoins
silence. In glowing terms he describes the row of
paintings, proving the truthfulness of his assertions
by bringing out a few of the subjects and
dilating upon their merits. After this there is another
&#8216;hurry up&#8217; tune, and then pandemonium
reigns supreme, as from their elevated stands the
ticket-sellers, each trying to outdo the other in
lustiness of tone, proclaim the price of admission&mdash;ten
cents. Very few resist the eloquence of the
orator and the cries of the ticket-sellers, and in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
short space of time the outside workers have a
chance to rest their lungs, as nearly all have
passed inside.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the old days of circus business the side-show
was justly styled the annex or museum department,
and contained only living curios and a performance
of Punch and Judy. Of late years this
has been greatly changed, there being such a
scarcity of freaks of nature that vaudeville acts,
and even minstrel shows, have been introduced to
fill up this vacuum. The interior is in charge of a
lecturer, who is usually either a magician or a
Punch and Judy man, he thereby serving a double
purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is always a feature upon which the side-show
revolves, either a giant or some other wonderful
freak of nature, and it always occupies a
high platform in the centre of the canvas. The
other stages are arranged in horseshoe shape, and
upon these the different curios are seated. All side-shows
have a snake enchantress, this being an
attraction that never fails to please, and the
rural visitor stands open-mouthed, with a look of
astonishment as the lady lifts these large serpents
one by one from their boxes and allows them to
coil about her person. She is supposed to answer
all questions put to her regarding the reptiles, and
is asked many strange ones, such as &#8216;Do you keep
them on ice?&#8217; &#8216;How do you feed them?&#8217; &#8216;Are they
stuffed?&#8217; &#8216;Did you catch them yourself?&#8217; As experience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
has made her quick-witted, she is ever
ready with a reply. The other curios are generally
a midget, a long-haired lady, or a tattooed man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Few would be considered complete without a
mind reader or fortune teller, who by merely tracing
the lines of the hand is able to foretell the
future. So, when Mary and John stand before
her, the lines of Mary&#8217;s hand always read that
John is the favored suitor and is to be her husband,
while those in John&#8217;s hand plainly indicate
that Mary is for him alone, and that their union
will be blessed with many little ones; which good
news sends them giggling and blushing on their
way, thoroughly satisfied at having parted with
their money, as it has brought them such good
results. All curios have the privilege of selling
their photos, which is really a part of their revenue,
and many a stray dime is coaxed from the
pockets of the country visitor to that of the
curio who is collecting a &#8216;pork chop fund&#8217; for the
winter. The initiated photo-seller knows which
States will be the most productive. This calls to
mind a remark made by a giant while on a trip
through Canada. One day after a fruitless endeavor
to foist his photos on the public, he demanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;How long here? Me want to go back to
Yankee-land.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thus he proved that the Yankees part with
their dimes more readily than the Canucks.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>&#8220;In order to fill the side-show with small circuses
there is always a candy stand, and whenever
there is a lull in the proceedings the voice
of the candy &#8216;butcher&#8217; may be heard calling his
wares in this manner: &#8216;Strawberry lemonade, ice
cold, is five cents to-day. Lemonade, peanuts,
cakes, candies, everything is five cents.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The space not taken up by stages is usually
occupied by slot machines, and many a stray
nickel is dropped into them during the day. The
lecturer, after going the rounds and giving a detailed
description of each curio, concludes the performance
with Punch and Judy, which, though the
oldest attraction before the public, is always a
source of amusement for the little folks, and even
the grown folks laugh and cheer as if they had
never seen it before. This being finished, the reed
manipulator steps from behind the frame and explains
to the gaping multitude how easily any
one can do the same with the aid of a reed made
by himself of silver and silk and &#8216;only costing ten
cents.&#8217; Children and grown folks alike, in their
eagerness to obtain one, push and almost knock
one another down, and within a few seconds old
and young alike have them in their mouths trying
to say &#8216;Oh! Judy, go get the baby.&#8217; The side-show
has been likened to a church fair, there being
something doing every time one turns around.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_077f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">BAREBACK RIDERS READY FOR THE RING.</p>



<p>&#8220;The band is always placed upon a high platform
directly behind the entrance, so that only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
thin canvas separates it from the outside public.
This is done in order that its noise may be easily
heard by the passing visitors, whom the ticket
sellers are always trying to entice to part with
their dimes to see the many wonders exhibited
within. This band stage is also used for the minstrel
and vaudeville performances which are given
as frequently as the occasion demands. The side-show
may be justly termed a continuous performance,
as there is always something going on
to entertain the visitors, who are continually
dropping in. When the eloquence of the orators
fails to arouse the many hangers-on who have
become listless, a curiosity is occasionally brought
out upon the &#8216;bally-hoo stage,&#8217; and the huge
triangle is struck upon to stir up those who are
still wavering. There is no let-up until all the
people have left the big show and concert. There
is then an opportunity for these hard-worked
people to eat supper and get a rest until 6:30,
when the side-show is again opened and remains
in operation until the big show is over, about
ten p.m.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hassan Ali, the Egyptian giant, eight feet two
inches tall (one has the orator&#8217;s word for it),
comes each year from the land of his nativity to
arouse American wonder and earn American
money. He is the pest of hotel keepers on the
route, for on Sunday nights he chooses to pass
the time for slumber away from the cramped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
recesses of the circus car and in the regulation
bedstead of commerce. The view of Hassan,
dreaming of his far-off home, with his brown legs
protruding, from the knees down, over the foot-board
and his skull rammed against the headpiece,
is a sight people flock from all parts of the
house to witness. About midnight, generally,
there is a noise like an explosion, a rattle, crash
and shimmer. The other circus guests turn over
and resume sleep; they know the familiar sound,
it is the shattering of the giant&#8217;s bed. The landlord,
hurrying to the apartment, finds Hassan on
the floor, enveloped in slats, sheets, counterpane
and mattress. This is almost a weekly performance
and causes Hassan to breathe awful Egyptian
imprecations against modern American furniture.
No visitor to the side-show has ever approached
him in height, and only one person, an aged man
wearing a G. A. R. badge, has been able to seize,
by standing on a chair, the photograph guaranteeing
circus admission which the giant holding
between upraised fingers and resting on the floor
is accustomed to offer as a reward for the feat.
Hassan was much mortified over the veteran&#8217;s
accomplishment, but finds balm in the consciousness
that no one else has duplicated the achievement.
His favorite exploit is to spread his extended
fingers from edge to edge of the top of an
ordinary waterpail. If you think it a simple digital
trick, try it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>The whole energies of a slender man with a trim
figure are devoted to entertaining the side-show
visitors. He talks almost unceasingly from morning
until night in brief but lucid descriptions of
the assembly of oddities. His addresses are delivered
with great ostentation and search after
effect. He is a man of easy wit and repartee, and of
tact and practical intelligence; qualifications necessary
to the successful conduct of his vocal calling.
Each &#8220;freak,&#8221; barring the &#8220;wild man,&#8221; has for
sale personal photographs, the receipts for which
the management lays no claim to. This is an
important part of their incomes, and the lecturer&#8217;s
failure to call attention to the offering brings
upon him reproach and censure. I attach one of
his harangues, exactly as he delivered it one
afternoon before an audience of grinning Connecticut
countrymen. It is interesting as a truthful
reproduction of a style of unique oratory which
prevails nowhere else.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now in about five minutes we will start our
regular show in here and have it all over forty-five
minutes before the circus commences. (The
band blows hard for five minutes.) Everybody
pay your attention this way. We commence our
show here first. I call your attention to Signor
Arcaris and sister. They will entertain you with
a wonderful performance known as the impalement
act, better known as knife-throwing,
without a doubt the best act of its kind in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
world. (The act and music.) Now down this
way next. I take great pleasure in introducing
Princess Ani, the wonder worker and mind reader.
We will have what is known as spirit calculations
on the blackboard. We will have a number of
gentlemen place some figures on the board. The
minute you place a figure on the board she knows
what figure you place there, although she is
blindfolded. She can describe anything and tell
you while blindfolded what you are thinking
about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to tell
you how this lady tells fortunes. She reads the
lines of your hand. Every line denotes some
peculiar trait in your character. Tells you what
you ought to do for your own benefit; tells you
what talent you possess; tells you when you are
going to get married; tells you how many children
you are going to have, if any. The line is there
in your own hand, you can&#8217;t get away from it.
Tells your lucky day, lucky number, family affairs,
love affairs. Tells how long you ought to
live by the life line of your hand! Now, it is all
private. She don&#8217;t tell it out loud. First she
explains about the large lines. She whispers so
that no one can hear but yourself. And for the
small lines you get what is known as the number.
The rest your hand-reading calls for is all printed
on this slip of paper. No two alike. Every one&#8217;s
fortune is different. Just show her your left hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
The price fifteen cents all the way through. Walk
right up and show her your left hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now to the stage. I call your attention to the
smallest lady ever placed on exhibition, Miss
Bertha Carnihan, twenty-nine years of age, stands
thirty-nine inches in height and weighs thirty-eight
pounds. The most perfectly formed little
lady on exhibition. She is well educated; has been
all over the world. Step up and have a talk with
her. She will answer all questions in regard to
herself. She also has her photographs for sale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now direct your attention to the large stage
in the centre. You will be entertained by Professor
Lowry&#8217;s Nashville students. (When the
negro concert is finished, the &#8220;big song book,
words and music, fifty songs, five cents a copy,&#8221;
are sold.) Now, fix your interest this way, please.
I call your attention to Miss Millie Taylor, better
known as the Queen of Long-haired Ladies. This
lady has without a doubt the longest hair of any
lady before the public. The length of the lady&#8217;s
hair is seven feet four inches. Step up and examine
it for yourselves. She also has her photos.
Now we come to Miss Julien, the world&#8217;s greatest
snake hypnotist. The lady will entertain you
with her large den of living monster reptiles, introducing
anacondas, boa constrictors, pythons
and the turtle-head snake of Florida. (The performer
coils snake after snake around her form.)
The lady now has one hundred and sixty-eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
pounds of snake around her body, neck and arms.
You will find her entertaining to converse with.
She will tell you all about snakes, etc. She also
has her photographs for sale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Over this way next. I call your attention to
the crowning feature of our side-show. The tallest
man in human history, Hassan Ali, better known
as the Egyptian giant. Born in Cairo, Egypt,
twenty-six years of age, stands eight feet two
inches in height and weighs three hundred and
twelve pounds. To give you a better idea in regard
to his height and reach we will allow the
tallest man in the audience to stand on this high
chair. The giant will stand on the ground. If the
man reaches up and touches the photograph Hassan
Ali holds up between his fingers, we will make
him a present of a ticket, taking him all the way
through the big show. There (pointing) is a tall
man. Would you be kind enough to stand on
this chair and reach with him. All right, you see
(turning to the audience) he comes about six
inches from it. This gives you an idea in regard
to the size of the giant&#8217;s hand. Here is a good-sized
water pail. See how far you can span it
Goes about half way. The giant spans it. His
fingers go two inches over the rim. Now, he has
no thick soles on his shoes, no high heels. There&#8217;s
his foot, No. 18. He also has his photographs
for sale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now pay your attention over that way. That&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Neola, the electric lady. By shaking hands with
her, you will receive a slight current of electricity,
the same as you would from a battery. Don&#8217;t be
backward, walk right up and shake hands with
her. She won&#8217;t harm you. She also has photos.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, the wild man! Down this way for the
wild man! Now, stop that crowding there! Take
your time, remember there are ladies and children
in the crowd. (He pulls the curtain aside and
pokes at the inmate with an iron bar.) There he
is, with flat head and low forehead, showing he
has very little brain. You notice the maniac
look of the eyes, just the same as a beast. He
has teeth just like a lion, arms four inches longer
than our arms and walks on all fours. Captured
in the everglades of Florida, a little over four and
a half years ago. Handcuffed and shackled ever
since he was caught. Now if you stop to think,
you know there is a cause for a monstrosity of
that kind. Just before he was born his mother
was frightened by a beast. It left the mark on
that freak of nature, just as you see for yourselves.
Half Indian, half negro, don&#8217;t understand
a word, don&#8217;t talk, growls like a beast, eats nothing
but raw meat. (He draws the curtain.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Now pay your attention there. You will be
entertained by musical Swarts. (A man gets
melody from bells and various instruments.) Over
this way next. The old-time funny Punch and
Judy. (He enters a booth, gives the familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
show and reappears.) Now, I will show you how
I change my voice. It is done with a reed, made
of silver and silk. All you have to do is place it
on your tongue and talk right. The sound of the
words goes through the reed just like this. (He
illustrates.) That&#8217;s the way to do it. There are
full directions how to use it. Ten cents, three for
a quarter. If they don&#8217;t blow as I represent, hand
them back and I will give you back your money.
(When the sales are finished he concludes in loud
tones:) The big show commences in five minutes.
All over in here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lusty-lunged orators on the outside make a
great clamor as the crowd passes out, and one of
them shouts: &#8220;The gentlemanly lecturer will now
pass around again, explaining the curiosities,
monstrosities and freaks of nature. Come on!
Come on!&#8221; The heartless band lures with brazen
notes and the scene is repeated without variation.</p>

<p>No feature of the side-show is more keenly relished
in the country towns than the Punch and
Judy show. The lecturer works the figures and
carries on the dialogue. The movements of the
puppets are managed simply by putting the hands
under the dress, making the second finger and
thumb serve for the arms, while the forefinger
works the head. Punch&#8217;s high back, distorted
breast and long nose give an increased zest to his
witticisms, and his career of violent crime is followed
with absorbed attention until he is dragged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
away to expiate it, and the curtain falls amid the
shouts of his conqueror.</p>

<p>The freak business is divided into about three
varieties, foreign, domestic and fake. In the first
class, the collectors travel all over the world in
search of rarities, but the very best freaks come
from India and the Malay peninsula. In those
countries there are people who breed freaks. They
buy young children and animals and deform them
while their bones are soft, by all manner of means.
Then they are constantly on the lookout for
genuine, natural freaks, and in those lands the
birth of a freak occurs very frequently. The headquarters
of this business is at Singapore. There
are, too, a number of men who devote themselves
to the discovering and placing of freaks of all
kinds and varieties, and scarcely a day goes by
in winter that we do not receive photographs and
illustrated circulars from some freak merchant
or other. Of course, there are faked freak men&mdash;a
perfect host in themselves. If the proprietor of
some little show needs an additional attraction
and does not have any money to hire something
good&mdash;for, like everything else, freaks have their
price&mdash;he can get something for little money that
will serve his purpose. The real, genuine, live
freaks always command high prices&mdash;from $50 to
$800 per week each&mdash;and travel all over the world
in order to exhibit themselves.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">
CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>AT THE MAIN ENTRANCE</small></h2></div>


<p>I have always regarded the two men who sell
tickets with a feeling of profound awe and solemn
wonder. There is something almost uncanny
about their daily exhibition. Their flying hands
put to shame the clutching display of the octopus.
No quicker-brained, more resolute or more peculiarly
gifted men are with the show. They face,
undaunted and calm, twice a day, a scene of confusion,
disorder and clamoring demand which
would put to his heels one not fitted perfectly by
nature and experience for the part. To see them
working their hands with lightning rapidity, directing,
advising and correcting, is to me as interesting
a study as the whole passing show affords.</p>

<p>When the crowd begins to gather about the
ticket wagon ready with the price of admission, it
would make infinitely easier the work of the men
inside if the sale began then. But business astuteness
bids delay. The throng grows fast, fills the
enclosure and swarms over the grounds. The
side-show orator, meanwhile, directs his seductive
eloquence at the perspiring mass and reaps a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
harvest. This is an advantage gained by no
undue haste in distributing tickets.</p>

<p>While this preliminary maneuvring is very
gratifying in its results to the management, the
burden it accumulates upon the two anxious men
in the ticket wagon grows every minute. When
finally the signal to begin operations is given, they
face a sea of upturned, distorted, perspiring faces,
and aloft the air is peppered with hands brandishing
admission money. Everybody is irrational,
unreasonable and excited. Children cry, women
are on the verge of collapse, and men push and
strain and mutter strange oaths. Uniformed employees
strive in vain to maintain order. The
wheels of the red wagon have been buried to the
hubs, or it would be swept away in the rush. The
mad, violent struggle continues for an hour, and
thousands force their path or are carried bodily
to the window and labor away with the cherished
strips of printed pasteboard. A mountain of bills
and coin grows and is toppled into baskets at
their side. Soon these are filled and money litters
the floor. There is no chance to assort or collect
it now. With eyes fixed steadily before them,
fingers and hands never lingering or sluggish, but
intercepting a counterfeit offering like a flash, they
work as if human automatons. Not until solitary
arrivals denote the end of the rush do they relax.
Thousands of dollars have changed hands in the
brief period, yet the scene will be duplicated a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
hours hence and the day will record a balance as
correct in detail as the most exacting banking
institution&#8217;s.</p>

<p>There is a popular misapprehension about the
moral purposes of the men in the ticket wagon.
The impression seems to prevail among many
sensible persons that they are modern highwaymen,
lurking there for prey. An intimate knowledge
of their character and conduct makes a
definite denial only fair to them. In the swift
shuffle of money, there is no intention on their
part to take advantage of the circus&#8217;s patron. It
is the fixed design of the management to inspire a
feeling of security and confidence, and the selection
of ticket-sellers has this end in view. Dismissal
and possible criminal prosecution would be the
penalty of detected &#8220;short change&#8221; or other
swindling methods.</p>

<p>There is only one legitimate source of outside
profit, and that is furnished by the &#8220;walkaway,&#8221;
circus vernacular for the person who unconsciously
leaves his change behind. He is legion, strangely
enough, and more remarkable still, it seldom
seems to occur to him to return for his own.
When he does it is promptly given him. Ticket-sellers
insist vehemently that the &#8220;walkaway&#8217;s&#8221;
contribution is not more than enough to reimburse
them for mistakes in count which are unavoidable
in the tumult, and more frequently than
not to the benefit of the purchaser. Whether their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
comrades accept this assertion without reservation
is not a subject to be discussed here.</p>

<p>Rates of admission are conspicuous everywhere.
Children under two and a half years of age are
admitted free; from that age to ten a half-ticket is
required, and older persons must pay full charge.
Wonderful and varied are the devices resorted to
in the effort to evade legitimate payment. Children
who at home are in their teens have dwarfed
to babyhood at the circus entrance. Parents
glibly insist that robust offsprings are under nine
years, and panting fathers and mothers present
themselves, in the palpable attempt to deceive,
with an armful of boy or girl who has reached the
full-rate limit. Watchful and inexorable door-keepers
receive them, demand and finally are
handed the correct sum, and composedly hear
themselves styled &#8220;a pack of villains and swindlers.&#8221;
Ill-grace characterizes those who would
cheat the circus.</p>

<p>To the main entrance come the hundreds of
written orders for tickets, issued by the advance
agents who have covered the district with bills
and posters. As a precautionary measure against
imposition, two sets of keen-eyed employees have
subsequently prowled over the routes and made
note when storekeeper or householder has not
kept faith. If the flaring advertisement has been
removed, disfigured, or hidden under that of a
rival show, a memorandum is made. Thus a list<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
of those who are and who are not entitled to
recognition is in the hands of the management
when the doors open. Each claim presented to
the ticket taker has a corresponding number on
the large sheet of paper which the general manager
holds, and whether or not the holder enters
free depends on its report. Very crestfallen and
embarrassed, generally, is the man who thought
he could profit without rendering service in return.
He had not calculated on the thorough business
system with which he was in contact. If the applicant
has kept his promise he is welcomed to
the show, given what his order calls for in the
way of seats and number of admissions, and
passes inside.</p>

<p>Each one of the men at the main entrance understands
his manifold duties perfectly and there
is no confusion. Annoying problems enough present
themselves, but the quick-witted, ready circus
man solves them without hesitation. Complaints
innumerable flow to the main entrance, but everybody
receives a fair hearing and just treatment in
so far as human effort can bring it about. Fault-finding
women are the bane. There is almost no
extreme of compromise to which the showman
will not go to rid himself of the presence of a
member of the other sex when she is wrought up
over a conviction that she has been imposed upon.
She blocks the passage way, gesticulating madly,
protesting volubly and threatening all manner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
things. She is generally tall and angular, wears
spectacles, carries a cotton umbrella, has a crying
child by the hand and is famous in the town as
a virago. Dutch and Curley cower before her outburst,
and the general manager promises her all
she demands if she will only pass on. With a
parting volley of abuse she flaunts into the menagerie
tent and a feeling of great relief pervades
all. Her reappearance, with a lament about the
unsatisfactory locality of her seat, may be confidently
expected later.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_090f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">BEFORE THE CROWD COMES.</p>

<p>Vigilant canvasmen picket the stretches of
cloth, alert lest the small boy or his older relative
crawl under the fabric and gain free admission.
The duty is one demanding keen eye and active
body, for once the canvas folds after the invader
he is generally secure from capture; a scamper under
the low rows of seats or into the crowd eludes
successful pursuit and recognition. So watchful,
however, are these patrolmen and so obdurate
against pleading juvenile persuasion that surreptitious
entrance is effectually barred. The
circus-fascinated but impecunious youngster must
needs vicariously satisfy his longing by turning
handsprings outside the barrier. The stirring
band music carried to his ears conjures immeasurable
pleasures in his mind and is madly irritating.</p>

<p>The press agent receives his newspaper guests at
the main entrance. They have been provided with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
tickets bearing his name. To the reporter assigned
to write up the circus and to the responsible
heads of the newspaper he gives slips of paper
passing them into an enclosure from which is
afforded an undisturbed survey of all that is
transpiring, and brings to closer view the excelling
features of the performance. Later he joins them
there, explains the show&#8217;s superiority over all
competitors and is generally entertaining. He
presses peanuts and lemonade upon them and
sends them away in friendly mood.</p>

<p>That manly young fellow who appeared from
the inner recesses of the festive tent for a whispered
conversation at the main entrance with the
general manager is Fred Ledgett, equestrian. He
is one of the principals in the season&#8217;s romance of
the circus. Dallie Julian, eighteen years old, who
turns back somersaults from the broad, rosined
haunch of her horse Gypsy, is the other party to
the charming affair. What they dared and suffered
before they could win the countenance and support
of management and relative and carry out their
matrimonial longing, only those who know intimately
the prosaic circus institute can appreciate.
If there is one thing frowned upon more than all
others in tented life, it is adventures of the heart.
But Fred and Dallie emerged triumphant and conquering,
and the seed of love sown in April came
to golden harvest in Iowa, many miles transplanted,
where an earnest, curious company of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
show people witnessed the wedding ceremony and
participated in the celebration.</p>

<p>My mind reverts to the early spring when little
Dallie, done up in a heavy coat and sitting on
one of the tubs which served as a seat for a trick
elephant, was holding an informal reception in
Madison Square Garden. Preparations for the
opening of the circus were in full swing&mdash;literally
in some instances&mdash;for the acrobats, practising for
the first time in a new place, were suspended by
&#8220;mecaniques&#8221;&mdash;the leather belts with rope attachments
that made living pendulums of them when
they missed their try. Even one of the bareback
riders, forming a pyramid on her husband&#8217;s shoulders,
while he went around the ring on three
horses, had the life-saving apparatus around her
waist. For she was new at the business and her
husband was not letting her take any more
chances than he could help. And while father and
mother were doing their great aerial act on horseback,
both of them looking as though only boy
and girl, their two-year-old baby cooed down at
the ringside, brought over from Boston to spend
three weeks with them. She thought it was fine
when her mother jumped and balanced, but her
mother thought of nothing except not to fall off
and not to hang her husband with the rope that
was her safeguard. They were in the middle ring
and beside it, swathed in top coats and wrappings
of all kinds, were performers waiting for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
turns to go in. From beneath their street clothes
came glimpses of pink and white fleshings with
slippers to match, and over the slippers were clogs,
wooden-soled shoes, with leather tops, to prevent
their feet from being injured while walking in the
ring.</p>

<p>The circus was getting ready to open and everybody
was practising to start in a blaze of glory.
In one of the end rings a woman was riding bareback,
&#8220;the best hurdle jumper in the business&#8221;
said one of the men. It looks easy to run and
jump on a horse, but it requires work and practice.
Not being a dress rehearsal, every one
was in working togs, and the women were wearing
bloomer suits, with waists of red, pink and
blue, and with that innate sense of decoration
that is part of the true artist in the ring, each
wore a rosette in her hair that matched the
suit.</p>

<p>Dallie&#8217;s interest was centred on the ring where
her aunt, who is also her foster mother, was
breaking in a new horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many of the people use the company&#8217;s horses,
but my aunt has her own and so have I,&#8221; she
explained. &#8220;She always breaks them herself and
this one is new to the business; that is why there
is a rope on him and the ringmaster hangs to it.
You see the horse might get frightened and bolt
over the side or try to go through the doorway,&#8221;
pointing to a niche that served as an entrance;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
&#8220;there is a man standing at the door to prevent
the horse from going out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The horse was perfectly well aware of the fact
and not altogether reconciled, although he was
fast approaching that state. Ropes swinging
from all sorts of corners where trapezes and
&#8220;looping-the-loop&#8221; contrivances were being put
up disconcerted him, but the rope and whip were
arguments that appealed in inducing him to stay.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will be all right before the performance,&#8221;
Dallie went on with the air of a connoisseur.
&#8220;There will be two more rehearsals to-day and
some chance to practise to-morrow. I am riding
the same horse I ride always,&#8221; she went on, tucking
her small feet out of the way of dirt and
draught, &#8220;and it is lucky for me because I have
only been practising two weeks this season. You
see I was in the hospital last winter, and all I
got of the circus was hearing the band play as I
lay in bed while all the others were getting ready
for this season. But I practised a lot this year
and now I do better than I did last year.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the upper ring the Rough Riders were putting
their horses through their acts and the horses
were not altogether pleased. The thing they
hated most was being made to lie down when
they did not feel the least bit tired, and many of
them were inclined to argue the matter until the
whip convinced them that really they preferred to
do what was wanted. The whip as a convincer in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
a circus is a great ethical force. At one end of the
course were the acrobats doing a complete double
shoulder twist. They were swinging by ropes
attached to their belts when they missed a leap.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said Dallie, shedding the great white
light of information, &#8220;they have never done their
turn here before and they are used to a smaller
place, so they are practising to get distances. If
one of them should miss and fall it would hurt,
for they haven&#8217;t any net under, but the &#8216;mecanique&#8217;
will keep them swinging clear from the
ground. You ought to see the &#8216;mecanique&#8217; in the
rings of the winter quarters. They are put on
people just learning to go bareback. Sometimes
they miss a horse and the persons go swinging
round and round the ring until they land on their
horses again. It is awfully funny. Some of the
people are scared this season because they are
new and there are a lot of new horses and so they
are nervous. My aunt told me the other day she
could not sleep nights for worrying about me and
how I would get through, but I told her she was
silly. I will get through all right and there is no
use any way in worrying, even if anything does
happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And isn&#8217;t it remarkable that some persons do
not get hurt?&#8221; she went on. &#8220;Now, here are all
of us and there hasn&#8217;t a thing gone wrong to hurt
any one. Why, yesterday one of the walking tight
wires broke when there were five people on it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
There was not one of them hurt; but a little boy
that was on the end had every one fall on him
and it scared him pretty bad and bruised him a
little, but he is practising to-day as usual.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her aunt&#8217;s horse by dint of much persuasion
was taking some baby hurdles while the aunt
hung on behind clinging to a strap, for the horse
did not seem to care about having a person
perched on his haunches, but he accepted it for the
same reason that he had all the rest. But at last
he was led from the ring and some one called
&#8220;Dallie!&#8221; She jumped down from her tub,
dropped off her long skirt, danced into the ring
and up to a big white horse. She wore a short
skirt over her dark bloomers and in her hand was
a very weather-beaten little whip.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have tried a lot of others,&#8221; she said, as she
bent it, &#8220;but I cannot turn somersaults with any
other. I am so used to this and the way it feels
in my hand that I cannot get along with any
other. I have lost this several times but some of
the men always find it and bring it back to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her horse, with its tightly checked head, waited
for her and she felt the head strap with the air of
an old professional.</p>

<p>Dallie stood up like a bit of thistle-down and,
poised lightly on her horse, went riding around.
First one of her feet and then the other went forward
to balance, and then suddenly both went
tight together and she took several preliminary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
leaps in the air to get herself limber. Having
stretched her muscles, she gave a little cry. Three
men, lined up together to catch her if she fell, got
ready, and up and over in the air she went like a
little human ball. The first time she did not land
on the horse but in the ring. But after that she
did her turn all right and was driven out to make
room for others needing practice.</p>

<p>Cupid had picked the little horsewoman out for
his mark in these early days of the circus, but so
closely guarded was the secret that it was days
before we knew that her heart had taken up its
lodging in young Ledgett&#8217;s breast, and his breast
had become the cabinet of her affections. Shy
glances and low and tender voices in secluded
spots finally told a revealing tale and we watched
the progress of the devotion with intense interest
and some concern. We knew the stern traditional
circus antipathy toward affairs of the kind and
wondered whether the fixed opposition of the aunt
could be overcome. No comrade was so disloyal
and unchivalrous as to carry the story to those
in authority, but soon the love-making conveyed
itself to their very eyes. Then began a systematic
effort to end it abruptly, and the memory of the
courage and faith and hope which forced surrender
to Hymen&#8217;s cause will linger with us long.</p>

<p>The burden of obstructions was directed at the
girl&mdash;he was too strong and self-reliant; and when
her aunt was not advising against her conjugal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
plans, the ringmaster engaged himself in telling
that marriage would jeopardize her future. So it
was that between the prodigious shakings of the
head and the love that absorbed her, Dallie grew
thin and pale and unsteady in her work. Her
judge of distance, so necessary in her dangerous
aerial revolutions, became bad, and often she
alighted on wooden ringbark or horse&#8217;s head or
tail when her feet should have been fixed to Gypsy&#8217;s
moving back. She became a bruised and
humble maiden, but with purpose unwavering.
Her aunt&#8217;s vigilance was unrelaxing and unrelenting;
she vowed that the two should not have each
other&#8217;s company.</p>

<p>To the casual circus goer, this determined disapproval
of innocent attachment may seem brutal
and unreasonable, but there are reasons underlying
which those directly involved feel justify
their course. It is the history of circus love
affairs which progress during the active season
that they impair performances. Once the yearning
enters show persons, indolence and indifference
characterize them in the ring. It is not a desire
to oppress, but a warning instinct of professional
deterioration, that causes sardonic smiles and
harsh flings. To the relative who has acted as
mother for years, the prospect of premature separation
is naturally obnoxious.</p>

<p>It was not until summer was on the wane that
we saw signs of approaching capitulation. Dallie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
had risen supreme over her temporary weakness
and was again the skilful mistress of the ring.
Fred, patient and artful, had won first an enduring
place in the aunt&#8217;s esteem and then her permission
and encouragement. The management
yielded before their combined eloquence.</p>

<p>So it was that one Sunday afternoon, Dallie,
swaying under a great breadth of silk, and her
sweetheart, awkward in encumbering black, but
looking very proud and joyful, started hand in
hand down the long road of life. A very glorious
supper was served that evening in honor of the
event. The owner gracefully proposed the health
of the bride, and the tent resounded with the enthusiasm
of the response. Fred expressed his
thanks in well-put words, and Mrs. Fred blushed
prettily in her happiness. And best of all, about
the corners of the aunt&#8217;s lip there rested a smile
of pleasure, of approval and of contentment.</p>

CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>THE MENAGERIE TENT</small></h2></div>


<p>Into the menagerie tent, with its great variety
of animals caged and unconfined, streams the
open-mouthed human parade, stopping to comment
and observe on its way to the &#8220;big top.&#8221;
The lions and tigers pace up and down their
cages with hungry eyes that gleam in green and
gold. They stare steadily through the iron bars
but take no heed of the pigmy humans who stare
back. There is something in those shining eyes
that tells of thoughts far from the circus, perhaps
of a jungle in far-off Asia. The insatiable elephant
swings his greedy trunk tirelessly, and the black
leopard sulks in the darkest corner of his den.
Watching closely the scene in all its aspects is a
jovial, deep-voiced man who urges the immediate
necessity of securing advantageous seats under the
adjoining canvas. He controls the peanut and
lemonade privilege. Long experience has taught
him all the arts and devices of his business. He
appreciates that his sales will not begin in any
volume until the audience is comfortably settled
inside. Then he displays his commercial craftiness
by overwhelming the big area with peanut and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
popcorn vendors. No lemonade is in evidence.
Thirst comes on apace. Throats become dry and
salty, and there is clamor for liquid. When its assuaging
presence is finally seen in the hands of
dozens of hawkers, the sale is invariably tremendous.
If sudden rain comes on during the
performance, he varies his sales with the disposal
of umbrellas. He is ready for any meteorological
condition.</p>

<p>He has been associated with red wagons and
white canvas for many years, and there is no
department of circus life in which he has not at
some time excelled. As a clown his fame covered
all parts of the country. He was, an old-time
programme before me tells, &#8220;a grotesque, whimsical
satirist. A wit brimful of ridiculously extravagant,
fanciful mirth and eccentric humor,
comic attitudes, funny songs, derisive sayings,
quaint arguments and pleasant drolleries; entirely
devoid of low jests and vulgar tricks and
postures.&#8221;</p>

<p>The monkey cage is the most popular institution
in our menagerie tent. We have outgrown
the &#8220;variety cage&#8221; of old days, which was a collection
in one den of monkeys, pigs, cats, dogs
and rabbits. It was an interesting collection, I
suppose, to country people, but an insufferable
nuisance to the showman. Circus monkeys die in
droves. The show which starts the season with
one hundred and fifty of the animals and returns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to winter quarters with twenty-five is fortunate.
The climatic changes act with quick fatality upon
the sensitive creatures. Tuberculosis, animal doctors
call the killing disease. There is always a
bully in the cage and always an inmate ready to
give battle for the honor. The privileges of the
bully are alluring. He takes for himself the choicest
morsels of food, chooses the most comfortable
perch or corner, gives orders and demands instant
obedience, and cuffs and bites and annoys his fellows
until one, rendered desperate, turns and
administers a thrashing and succeeds to the position.
The monkey cage at nightfall is a sure
register of the degree of generosity of a community.
In some towns they are gorged with
food; the audience has fed them lavishly. Again,
they give pleading indication of hunger; the place
has probably a reputation for penuriousness.
Those who believe in the Darwinian theory assert
that the resemblance between the human race and
the monkey is most marked in sick monkeys.
Several scientists who watched our sick chimpanzee
noticed many peculiarities of a child. It
coughed like a child and made wry faces like one
when asked to take medicine. Doctors felt its
pulse and it received all the care and attention of
a child of the rich.</p>

<p>Natural history is one of the most interesting
and absorbing of all studies, and the visitor to
our menagerie finds much zoological gratification.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
The hippopotamus, sleeping or floundering in his
tank, and raising his head at intervals above the
surface of the water for the purpose of respiration,
is never without a wondering audience. His is a
harmless disposition and he is a pet with the animal
keepers. His den is too small for the water
to cover him completely and frequently he is
scrubbed with soap. He enjoys the operation
immensely unless the soapsuds enter his cavernous
mouth, which surely is annoying enough to provoke
the most mild-mannered being. His skin is
of a dark reddish-brown color, full of cracks,
chaps and cross-etchings, with dapplings of irregular
dark spots, and is probably two inches thick.
He is more than ten feet long and nearly six feet
high. When he gives voice, the lions are humiliated
and the tigers acknowledge defeat. It is a
deafening kind of interrupted roar, between that
of a bull and the braying of an elephant. His
daily diet is bushels of potatoes, apples, carrots,
oats, bran, hay and salt. Keepers say that the
only hippopotami born in captivity are in the zoo
of one of the big cities. Ignorance permitted the
first one which saw the light to die. Keepers
feared to put it in the water, thinking it would
drown, and tried to nurse it with a bottle. It
was dead in ten days. Then it was decided not to
interfere when the mother brought forth its next
young. The result was the discovery that it
nursed under water. The first genuine hippopotamus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
ever seen in America was exhibited by Barnum
in his New York museum in August, 1861.
He advertised the animal extensively and ingeniously
as the &#8220;great behemoth of the Scriptures,&#8221;
and thousands, including many biblical students,
flocked to see it.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_104f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A &#8220;MAN KILLER,&#8221; PHOTOGRAPHED HALF AN<br /> HOUR AFTER
HAVING SLAIN AN ANNOYER.</p>

<p>Circus people will travel miles into the presence
of a giraffe. They want the animal with the
elongated neck to rub their hand with its tongue.
They say that good luck is sure to follow the
operation. The privilege is one rarely accorded,
for giraffes are very costly and delicate, and,
though popular menagerie inmates, are infrequently
seen nowadays. The first one born in
captivity in America saw the light of day in Cincinnati
on October 20, 1889. It was five feet
high. Daisy, measuring eighteen feet from the
ground to the tips of her ears, and the last giraffe
then on exhibition with any travelling show, was
killed during a voyage to Europe&mdash;a lurch of the
ship broke her neck.</p>

<p>Circus owners are vainly searching the jungles
of India and the wilds of Africa for rhinoceroses.
There are none in the open markets and the
world&#8217;s visible supply is limited to twelve specimens.
The market value of the beast ranged
from $4,000 to $5,000 until the present shortage
set in. Now a large circus would willingly pay
many times that sum. The rhinoceros has always
been a problem to animal keepers, for captivity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
generally results in early death. He is a beast
so essentially of the wilds that all efforts at
breeding in captivity have failed. Old showmen
remember the attempt to take performing liberties
with one of the spike-nosed monsters in a
small town in Illinois in 1872. He killed two
men, upset four dens of animals, tore down a
museum tent, stampeded people for blocks and
finally brought up in a vacant house, the door
of which stood open. No fixed desire to exhibit
a rhinoceros has ever since been displayed.</p>

<p>To many persons who go to a circus there is
probably nothing that causes more wonder than
to see the keepers of the lions, tigers, leopards,
panthers and other wild beasts sitting in the
cages among them, patting them on their ugly
heads, slapping them on their saliva-dripping
jowls, or fearlessly lashing them with their whips
if necessary. Mastery expresses better than training
what the keepers have accomplished with the
beasts.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a tremendous amount of work to be
done in winter quarters, of which the public knows
nothing,&#8221; explained our keeper, as he surveyed the
scene in the menagerie tent early one August
evening. &#8220;We are getting new wild animals all the
time, and as they come to us there is not a man
living who would dare go into the cages with
them. During the winter we have to break those
beasts so that we can handle them on the road.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
When they come to us they have thick leather collars
around their necks, with heavy chains attached.
The beasts are then more savage than
they were before capture, that having served only
to bring out all that is ugly in them. They will
spit and growl at anybody who comes near their
cage, and jump at the bars until they exhaust
themselves. We begin to teach them manners the
very day we get them, and they take a lesson in
etiquette every day after that until the show
starts out. My men catch the end of the chain
fastened to the collar and secure it in such a manner
to the bars that the beast can move only a
short distance. Then I take a stout rawhide whip
and strong club and enter the cage. I take a
chair and sit down in a corner. The instant I
get in, the beast will give a roar and spring for
me. I would be torn to shreds if I were within
reach; but the chain holds and instead of getting
at me, the lion, tiger, panther or leopard is
brought up with a shock that sends him in a heap
to the floor and I give him a lash with the rawhide.</p>

<p>&#8220;The beast is at me again in an instant; again
he goes down and again I lash him. I always
keep the club handy, but never use it unless it is
absolutely necessary. I keep drawing my chair a
little closer to the animal as this goes on until I
get so close he can touch me with his nose but
cannot bite me. Then I just sit there and talk to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
him and you would be surprised at the power the
human voice will finally be made to exercise over
wild beasts. They seem to understand much that
is said to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;While I am talking just out of reach of their
teeth,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;if they get ugly and attempt
to spring at me I give them the rawhide. I keep
this up, and after a dozen or fifteen lessons they
get so they only snarl and growl at my entrance
to the cage. As soon as I think it is safe I try
the beasts without a chain. It is a little ticklish
business at first but I have plenty of help ready
for the first effort. If it is a success the first time,
you generally have your beast mastered, although
once in a while a brute that has been tractable
enough will break out and go for his keeper. We
had such a case once when an experienced lion
tamer was clawed by a lioness and nearly killed.
We usually cut the claws of the cat species, however.
Lions will not stay in the same cage with
tigers. We tried this once, putting a lioness in
with a Bengal tiger. There was a fierce fight and
the lioness nearly killed the Bengal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our keeper takes very little stock in the theory
of the power of the human eye over wild beasts.
The organ plays an insignificant part, he thinks;
it is the power of the man behind the eye and
the qualifications he possesses that are efficacious.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_108f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">REHEARSING IN WINTER QUARTERS.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a pretty thing to say, and that is all,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;The man who wants to subdue a wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
beast has to be fearless and go about his task in
a courageous way, and of course the eye plays its
part. The man who attempted to handle a wild
beast that was not chained, with nothing else
than a fearless eye would be in a pretty bad hole,
though. What the man must have is a good
heart, plenty of pluck and lots of sand. The
secret of successfully handling wild beasts is to become
imbued with a confidence that all wild beasts
are really cowardly, especially if they belong to
the cat family. If you are not afraid and you
know how to do it, it is easy enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;A circus man once determined to put the question
whether the human eye has power over wild
animals to the test. Approaching a large ostrich
he gazed fixedly at it, and to his delight the mesmeric
glance seemed to meet with instant success.
The bird crouched and flapped its wings nervously.
Some hours later, however, the man&#8217;s body was
found with the ostrich alternately sitting and
jumping upon it. The negro guide of a circus
expedition, it is told, was more successful, although
there is some doubt as to whether it was
the power of the eye that gave him victory. He
surprised two lion cubs at play and began to play
with them. They liked it so much that when he
would take his departure they refused to let him
go. Their cries of enjoyment finally brought the
mother lioness. The negro was paralyzed with
fear, and kept his eyes glued to those of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
lioness. Man and beast kept steadily watching
each other. The lioness moved around the negro
several times but he never shifted his gaze. Several
times the lioness crouched as if to spring, but
finally after what seemed an age to the negro she
called her cubs to her side and disappeared in the
forest. This is the story brought home from
Africa.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man once experimented with a wildcat in
our circus, and only the bars of the cage prevented
him from being badly scratched for his
pains. As soon as he looked into the eyes of the
wildcat the animal sprang fiercely at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some interesting experiments were made at
our winter quarters in Bridgeport one year with
the object of ascertaining the exact influence of
music on animals. That animals like to hear a
violin played seems to be clearly proved. A zoologist
played in the menagerie many times, and
found that the music pleased them. A puma, at
the sound of the violin, stretched himself at full
length in his cage and listened quietly as long
as the music was soft and low, but the moment it
became loud and fast he sprang to his feet, lashed
his sides with his tail and began to pace nervously
up and down his cage. A jaguar at the
sound of lively music showed great uneasiness,
but became quiet when soft music was played. He
thrust his paws through the bars of the cage to
detain the violinist. On leopards the music made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
hardly any impression. A lioness and three cubs
seemed somewhat disturbed, but as soon as the
player started to go to the next cage they came
forward and lay down. He then played soft music
which seemed to please them. He followed it with
a lively dance, at the first sound of which the
cubs sprang up and gambolled wildly about the
cage. On the other hand, two striped hyenas,
when they heard the music, drew back to the
other end of their cage and tried to get out
through the bars.</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember well the year 1889,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;because then the question of electrocuting, instead
of hanging, prisoners condemned to die came
up. A party of scientists came on to our winter
quarters and conducted a series of electrical experiments
upon the animals. Mr. Bailey placed the
entire menagerie at the service of the scientists,
and twenty of us keepers assisted in the work.
The instruments employed were a powerful battery
of forty-two Leclanche cells and a resistance box
of one hundred thousand ohms. The experiments
began at eleven o&#8217;clock in the morning and continued
until nightfall.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first animal experimented with was a
savage baboon, which fought furiously before he
was tied. He bit one keeper severely and tore the
clothing off another. A sponge, that was used as
the end of one wire, was forced into his mouth.
A second sponge was fastened on one of his paws.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
A current of two cells was then passed through
the simian and was promptly resented by a fierce
attempt to break his bonds and escape. The
baboon&#8217;s irritation increased with the current
until twenty-eight cells had been used. When
forty cells had been used, the animal became lethargic
and almost comatose, looking for all the
world like a man overcome by strong drink. The
highest point of resistance was eight thousand
ohms, a surprisingly large figure. When finally
released, the baboon became wild with rage and
attacked the nearest keeper, inflicting a dozen
scratches on him. A tame seal was next operated
on. It allowed the experts to fasten one roll of
copper wire around its neck and a second around
its tail flippers. The moment the current was applied
it snapped viciously in every direction. The
savants sprang right and left, upsetting chairs
and writing materials in their haste to get out of
reach. When the current was increased the seal
gnawed at the wires and succeeded in disengaging
itself from both. The resistance could not be
ascertained on account of its wet coat acting as
a conductor to the electric fluid.</p>

<p>&#8220;The gnu or horned horse, did not take kindly
to science. When one of the savants entered its
cage it attacked him so savagely, that three keepers
were obliged to go to his assistance. The animal
showed a resistance of eleven thousand ohms
and seemed paralyzed the moment the current was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
turned on. The small monkeys behaved very much
like little children. The moment they felt the
current they screamed and seemed to be undergoing
agony. When the wires were removed, they
appeared puzzled and three of them took up the
electrodes as if to study them. A large blue monkey
was so interested that when released he seized the
large sponge and began to tear it apart as if to
see what it contained that hurt him so. The monkeys
offered a resistance of from five thousand to
seven thousand ohms. The hippopotamus and sea
lion took the full force of the current without
wincing; but a dog, after having a moderate current
passed through his brain, showed signs of
hydrophobia and had to be killed. The wild
carnivora showed much sensitiveness to the electric
current, manifesting every symptom of rage
and distress when only a single cell was employed.
A wolf to which a mild current was applied, stood
upon its haunches and cried piteously.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the elephants proved the star attractions.
They actually enjoyed the sensation in every instance,
except when a strong current was passed
through the trunk. When only a few cells were
employed, the huge beasts did not seem to observe
the fact, but when the full battery was employed,
they rubbed their legs together, caressed savant
and keeper alike and squealed their pleasure. No
odder sight was ever seen than an elephant with
mouth wide open, with one scientist holding a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
sponge to the huge tongue and a second another
to the root of his tail, and manifesting every sign
of glee.</p>

<p>&#8220;The manner in which animals endure pain always
awakens our sympathies. Horses in battle
are a striking example of power of endurance and
unyielding courage. After the first stinging pain
of the wound, they make no sound, but bear their
agony with mute, wondering endurance. Elephants
also suffer agonies without flinching.
When they are shot in a vital spot they sink
down on the ground with a low cry, and silently
pass away. A dog will go for days with a broken
leg without complaint, and a wounded cat will
crawl to some quiet place and brood silently over
agonies which humans could not endure. A
stricken deer will go to some thick wood and there
in pitiful submission await the end. Lions, tigers
and other beasts will do the same. Seldom do
they give utterance to cries of pain. Cattle will
meet the thrust of the butcher&#8217;s knife without a
sound, and a wild dove, with shot from a hunter&#8217;s
gun burning in its tender flesh, will fly to some
high bough or lie on the ground to die, and no
sound will be heard save the dripping of its life
blood upon the leaves. The eagle, stricken high in
air, will struggle to the last, but there will be no
sound of pain, and the proud defiant look will not
leave the eyes until the lids close over them and
shut out the sunlight they love so well.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>Sunday is fast-day in the menagerie tent, and
every occupant, caged or uncaged, knows when
the day arrives. When the week-day feeding hour&mdash;five
o&#8217;clock in the afternoon&mdash;approaches, not
one of the animals betrays the feeling of eager
desire on Sunday which characterizes them all the
other six days. They understand instinctively
that there will be no meal. Then on Monday the
&#8220;cat&#8221; animals begin to pace their cages nervously
and peer through the bars awaiting the coming of
the keepers. They are well aware that liver, which
they relish keenly and which keeps them in good
physical condition, will be the food. The Sunday
abstinence is deemed by the trainers an aid to
good health, as copying to some extent the habit
of beasts in their native haunts, where food is not
obtainable every day. There is little sickness in
the menagerie. The animals are studied closely
and given assiduous attention if the slightest indisposition
is manifested.</p>

CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>LIFE WITH THE PERFORMERS</small></h2></div>


<p>The art of seating the audience in the big tent
plays a prominent part in the receipts of the day.
&#8220;Fill the highest rows first,&#8221; is the instruction
forced upon each usher, and censure or dismissal
is the penalty of disobedience. By skilful and
systematic arrangement of the crowds, it is possible
to utilize every inch of seating space in the
vast enclosure. Indifferent or careless performance
of the duty leaves the tent, to the casual observer,
packed to completion, but in reality here and
there are spots not occupied. Hence all ingenuity
must be brought to bear to prevent this condition
and its consequent financial loss, for the sale
of tickets stops when no more seats are available.
Sometimes a prosperous day has not been confidently
expected and the management orders a
four- instead of the usual five-centre-pole tent
raised. The difference in seating capacity is several
hundred. Then, but not often, for circus
foresight is keen, people flock to the lot in thousands
and there is no room for their accommodation.
The owner is shame and mortification personified.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>On the hippodrome track one of the clowns,
clad in sober black and looking to be all he represents,
waits with imitation camera and tripod for
victims. He is an experienced master of human
nature. With exaggerated politeness and scrupulous
care of detail he poses unsuspecting new-comers,
to the boisterous amusement of those
already seated. Sweethearts stand in affectionate
attitude, mightily pleased and unsuspecting, while
he pretends to impress their likeness upon photographic
plates. Sometimes he turns their faces
from him, tells them not to move until instructed,
and then moves quietly away. Very infrequently
they take the joke seriously. When anger and
retaliation are manifested, he is agile enough to
escape punishment.</p>

<p>A boy sings on the topmost seats. His voice is
powerful, but pure and sweet, and the tent is
filled with the sounds of approval when he finishes.
The musical director discovered him in Rochester,
N. Y., and has great hopes for his professional
future.</p>

<p>The military band is discoursing popular selections,
and the equestrian director makes a last
critical survey of the network of suspended bars,
trapezes, rings, perches and wires. Finishing
touches are being added to the &#8220;loop-the-loop&#8221;
apparatus. A score of men have been putting it
together since early morning. Now the band is
at the dressing-room exit and the cornet sounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
a melodious call. The inaugural tournament is
on, comprising, the press agent is telling his
guests, &#8220;spectacular pageantry, zoologic, equestric,
hippodromatic and aerial elements, indicative
of the limitless resources of this colossal consolidation
of circus chieftains, collection of celebrities
and congress of champions; a comprehensive,
kaleidoscopic and illustrative review upon the
ellipse of the hippodrome, upon the two stages
and in the three rings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the clowns&#8217; carol, the herds of trained elephants
and the circus performance that is familiar
to the young and old. The ringmaster&#8217;s whip
cracks merrily; ponies and dogs show the results
of patient teaching; slack wire equilibrists, head
balancers and daring horizontal bar heroes are
innumerable; there are graceful flights upon flying
trapeze and swinging rings; living classic statuary
pleases the eye; hurdle riding, a hazardous form
of equestrianism, gives the audience a thrill;
prancing thoroughbreds engage in a cakewalk,
and the clowns burlesque it; a crowd of acrobats
and jugglers fill the rings simultaneously, while a
septette of men and women engage in fancy and
trick bicycle riding, and the most intrepid wheelman
rides down a ladder which stretches to the
dome of the canvas; a performing bear shows almost
human intelligence, and some one dressed
like a monster rooster evokes general mirth; a
young man, standing on the pedals of a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
wheel with no support save his nerve, makes his
perilous journey up and down a spiral arrangement,
which has a curious effect upon the snare
drum; an eighteen-year-old girl turns somersaults
upon a moving white horse&#8217;s back, and the onlookers
read that she is the only one of her sex
accomplishing the feat.</p>

<p>So the show progresses to the rushing hippodrome
races, contests between women on fiery
thoroughbreds, double standing Roman bareback
races, tandem hurdle races, jockey races, pony
races with monkey jockeys, clowns in comical
competition, and the breath-taking chariot race.
It is now that the country crowd perhaps gets a
thrill that is denied the New York city audience.
In Madison Square Garden the hippodrome track
is dry and firm and smooth and true. The country
course offers none of these conditions. No
time is granted to make it perfect. And so it is
that sometimes there is a wild cry from rider or
driver, a confused heap of hoofs, legs, wheels and
dust, breathless silence from the thousands of
onlookers and then, generally, a loud burst of applause
as horse and human struggle to their feet,
not seriously damaged. The danger of disaster is
especially great when the four fleet horses are
dashing with the heavy, low Roman chariots.
Great skill is required to prevent collision or collapse
on the abrupt course; and rough, uneven
grounds make serious strain upon the vehicle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
The accidents seldom have disastrous endings. I
remember vividly when an axle broke in a Pennsylvania
town. The woman driver jumped and
escaped with a sprained wrist. The band instantly
stopped its thumping. The horses, racing
madly and unguided to the finish post came to an
abrupt standstill. The audience, on a verge of a
panic, resumed their seats, marvelling. They did
not understand, that as a precautionary measure
against just such accidents, the fiery animals are
trained to run with the music. They have been
taught not to move rapidly until the band begins
and to stop whenever its melody ceases.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the women who rush
around the hippodrome track in the jockey races
ride in an opposite direction from that of the
other sex, and the reason is not apparent to the
lay visitor. The explanation is that thus their
feet swing on the horse&#8217;s side not exposed to the
supporting quarter-pole, as would be the case did
they follow the course of the men. Disregard of
this precautionary measure has resulted in serious
injury in many circuses, for the circus woman
makes light of danger in many forms which
would appall her unprofessional sister. The natural
route is the men&#8217;s, and she would take it every
time did the equestrian director permit.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_120f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">RING &#8220;STARS&#8221; LINED UP FOR INSPECTION.</p>

<p>Of course, most skilled performers &#8220;stall.&#8221; That
is, in the execution of a particularly dangerous or
difficult feat, they pretend to barely escape a serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
fall or make an unsuccessful attempt at accomplishment.
It gives the audience an exaggerated
idea of the extreme peril or difficulty of the
undertaking, and ensures an outburst of applause
when finally triumphantly done. It is a sidelight
on the mild vanity of the circus man, but incidentally
serves a commercial purpose, for he
knows that public approval carries with it renewal
of engagement at no smaller salary.</p>

<p>Nearly all on the list of circus performances
have inherited their strength and skill. They have
been literally born to the arena. Some of them
represent the third and fourth generations of
famous circus families. The boys and girls of our
circus, comprising two tiny concert dancers, a
smart young bicycle rider, several acrobats and
gymnasts and two Japanese boys, are a modest,
healthy, honest party of playmates whose parents
find time each day to hear lessons and give advice
in manners and morals. They are &#8220;chums&#8221;
in all the word implies, and an occasional clash
with words or fists always ends without the call
for parental adjustment and serves to cement the
juvenile friendship. Of young men and women,
those who have not yet reached their majorities,
we have half a dozen, all of whom have conspicuous
parts in the show. One of the girls, a skilled
acrobat, took up riding recently and bids fair to
achieve fame, the veterans say. The act does not
interfere with her other performance and she is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
receipt of a handsome income. The most finished
tumbler among the lads is a boy who also participates
in a wire-walking act. In this performance
he is disguised as a girl, for the feminine sex
always lends interest to any feat. The deception
is perfect, but it was very annoying to the management
and embarrassing to the youth when his
blonde wig dropped off one afternoon and he
stood revealed in his masculinity. So it is with a
&#8220;family&#8221; who do a graceful and dangerous aerial
act. The youngest member of the troupe is a
boy, although appearance indicates the other sex.
They are both eagerly biding the time when age
will do away with the disguise.</p>

<p>The training of these children begins almost at
birth. Indeed, in the vast majority of cases there
is the powerful effect of heredity, which exercises
an influence upon the child and helps it to overcome
obstacles to others well-nigh impossible. The
chief effort is to create courage and daring, to
develop those qualities where they already exist.
The lungs are expanded and broadened by hearty
exercise, and the muscles are hardened and developed
by athletic work. At the same time it
has been found by the modern gymnast that the
body, to perform this extraordinary work, must
be well nourished. The necessity for a clear head,
a steady eye and unflinching hand requires that
the brain shall likewise be well nourished; so the
education of the little pupils is not neglected;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
indeed, many a gymnast has mental abilities often
lacking in the ordinary man. He has to understand
some geometry and mathematics, else how
can he calculate the exact distance of a jump, a
fall, a somersault? He very often is the inventor
of his own apparatus and this has to be exact in
shape, size and strength. The suppleness of the
limbs and joints comes from long practice, not, as
is usually thought, from straining the soft joints
of a child. The result of such straining would be
weakness, not strength. Only those whose business
it is know or understand what can be done
with those joints, how much strain they will bear
and which will endure the greatest strain. When
to hold on and when to let go are important
items, too, in an acrobat&#8217;s training. These can
be learned only when young. It is natural for a
child to &#8220;catch at something&#8221; when it thinks it is
falling. It must be taught to do the catching
only at precisely the right moment, and to turn
at the instant when required.</p>

<p>In these days, the net is an element of safety in
all mid-air feats. But so fearless and confident do
gymnasts become that they hardly know and
certainly do not notice whether it is in place.
There is a piece of apparatus largely used among
circus riders when training or learning new feats
called the &#8220;mecanique.&#8221; It consists of a belt,
which goes around the waist of the performer, to
which is attached a strong, elastic rope, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
again fastened to a wooden, gibbet-like arm. The
tyro knows that he cannot possibly fall beyond
the length of the rope and that, therefore, no
matter how many times he fails, he cannot by
any possibility come to physical grief. The use of
this machine is deprecated by some performers as
reducing the nerve training to a minimum. It is,
however, in great favor with all whose nerves are
already steadied by experience and who are trying
new tricks. In the case of women and children the
&#8220;mecanique&#8221; is very frequently employed.</p>

<p>There is no phase of work that requires more
patient and faithful study, more steadiness of
nerve or a greater command of the muscles than
feats of balancing on trapeze, rings and slack
wire. To balance well, one must be systematically
developed, and each muscle must be ready to act
instantly and do its work with certainty. The
legs must be strong and firm to sustain the body
in its various poses. The back must be sinewy,
so that the recovery may be made quickly and the
upright maintained without a chance of failure,
and the arms and hands must be hard and strong;
for when a man, falling from a trapeze, grasps at
the bar, he must catch it and hold to it if he
desires to emerge unhurt. Balancing on the slack
wire is essentially different from trapeze balancing.
On the slack wire the balance must be kept by
working the body from the waist down, and is
mainly done with the legs. It is the reverse on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the trapeze, where the legs must be kept rigid and
the balance worked from the leg up. The slack
wire is harder to learn at first than the trapeze,
as it is radically different from a person&#8217;s natural
balance, which is kept more with the arms and
body and less with the legs.</p>

<p>The triple somersault has slain its scores, yet
as long as men tumble over elephants in the circus,
and as long as springboards are made, the acrobats
will be trying to accomplish this most difficult
of feats. There have been acrobats who have
done it. They are dead now. They were carried
out of the ring to a hospital immediately
thereafter, and lived for the various periods of
from one to three days. There have been men
who have asserted that they can turn the triple.
They are generally the acrobats who have left
the circus ring forever and are devoting the last
years of their lives to the sale of cigars or some
other stirring occupation. The men who have
followed the circus all their lives say that no
man has ever turned the triple from a springboard
and lived to boast of his triumph. The
triple somersault is done from a flying trapeze,
but it is simply a series of revolutions in the air
as the performer drops. Even then it should be
called two and a half revolutions, for the acrobat
falls on his back in a net and depends upon the
rebound to hurl him to his feet. He can make
these two revolutions and a half from a springboard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
sometimes, with the difference that nine
hundred and ninety-nine times out of a thousand
he alights on his head or on the back of his neck
which brings instant death. A man who even
falls that way in a net is a subject for the coroner.</p>

<p>It is circus tradition that in 1842, when even
the double somersault was deemed a difficult and
dangerous feat, a performer tried the triple turn.
It happened in Mobile, Alabama, and the rash
acrobat broke his neck. W. J. Hobbes, a tumbler,
was killed attempting the trick in London four
years later. John Amor, a Pennsylvania circus
leaper, who was a famous double somersault
revolver, paid with his life for his ambition in
1859. He was travelling with an English circus,
essayed the death-dealing act, struck on his forehead
and died.</p>

<p>The somersault, whether it be single or double,
is a feat which requires the most assiduous practice
and the most accurate calculation. The first
thing which the tumbler learns is to jump from a
springboard. The sensation of springing through
the air is an uncanny one. Next is the &#8220;stock&#8221;
somersault, which consists of merely springing up
in the air and slowly, and with practically no
muscular exertion, turning over. The motion is
so slow that the spectators hardly realize that the
man has revolved. Then begins the drill for the
real somersault. The acrobat learns the &#8220;tuck,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
which consists of grasping both legs tightly half
way between the knee and ankle and pressing
them closely together. At the same time the acrobat
puts the muscles of his shoulders and back
into play. This muscular force acts like the balance
weight of the wheel. It aids him to complete
the revolution. The taking of the &#8220;tuck&#8221; requires
the nicest calculation. The acrobat must wait
until he has sprung as far in the air as the force
of the springboard or his legs will carry him. If
he &#8220;tucks&#8221; too soon he will fall like a coffee sack.
If he waits until too late he finds himself cast, a
human wheel at a dead centre. He is likely to
have broken bones in either case in spite of carpet
or mattress. The double somersault requires more
muscular force. The trained acrobat knows exactly
where he is at every point in the revolution.
He has a strange sense which makes him feel it.
It is when he summons his almost exhausted
energies for a third turn that he feels like a ship
without a rudder. Harry Costello, Wm. Kinkead,
John Armstrong, Arthur Mohring, and &#8220;Little
Bob&#8221; Hanlon, well-known circus performers, have
broken their necks and died in executing the
double somersault within a score of years.</p>

<p>The dressing-rooms&mdash;the &#8220;green room&#8221; of the
circus&mdash;are as convenient to the centre of the tent
as the topography of the lot will permit. Passing
through the canvas connection, the women of the
show enter quarters to the left and the men&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
accommodations are on the other side. Between,
stand the horses and wagons and other &#8220;property&#8221;
which for various reasons cannot be stored
near the rings. Very cosy and comfortable are the
two canvas compartments, although room is at a
premium. Trunks replace chairs, and mirrors are
of a dimension to discourage vanity. The process
of &#8220;making up&#8221; is a laborious, and tedious undertaking,
but accepted as one of the conditions
which are unavoidable. Of cold water there is a
plenty, and soap and towels abound. Naphtha
lights furnish illumination. Electric experiments
have never been successful.</p>

<p>The music of the band furnishes the circus man&#8217;s
cue. He knows by its brazen notes when to
leave the dressing-room for the ring. If the
musical director changes an air, the dressing-room
inmates must be thoroughly informed to avoid
delay and confusion. No performer is permitted
to leave until the entire show is over. The danger
of accident in the ring is never absent, and as
many do several &#8220;turns&#8221; others must be ready
if one becomes incapacitated. When the nights
grow cold in the early and late season, the chill
air which penetrates the canvas would drive any
but the hardy circus folk to a sick-bed. Their
trained systems are equal to all demands the elements
put forward, however, and a cough or a
cold are almost unknown. A miserable enough
place it is when the rain falls freely. Scant as is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the dressing-room protection, the journey to and
from the rings is infinitely worse. Performers return
to their trunks wet in the feet and generally
bestrewed with drops from the head down. Pretty
costumes are spotted and the effect is very depressing.
There is peril to life and limb, too,
when bars and trapezes and rings and other apparatus
becomes drenched. Hands may slip, feet
may not hold, a horse may stumble, and there
are numberless other chances of misfortune. The
equestrian director decides whether or not the
possibility of disaster is too great for the act. If
he deems the risk not too venturesome, the performer
accepts cheerfully, no matter what is his
own conviction. Sometimes he enters upon the
duty with grim forebodings as to the outcome,
for he appreciates that perhaps the director, in
his desire not to disappoint the audience, has
imposed a critical undertaking. The circus concert
offers opportunity for a display of talents
other than those presented in the ring. Many performers
with nimble foot or tuneful voice add to
their incomes by this extra work.</p>

<p>Circus performers are persons of large and unwearied
charity and compassion. No comrade is
deserted in affliction or distress. Contributions
of money and sympathy flow in upon him, and
none fails to subscribe. If the situation requires
more money than one circus is able to provide,
word of the need is sent to friends with other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
similar organizations and there is always prompt
and ready response. I know of a dozen invalids
who are to-day being supported solely by the
liberal benevolence of comrades.</p>

<p>Two benevolent societies are with the Barnum &amp;
Bailey circus, the B.O.S.S. and the Tigers. Each
makes a weekly collection from the members and
pays $15.00 weekly to the sick or disabled. Last
year $9,000 was collected and $8,000 disbursed.
The balances remained in the treasurers&#8217; hands for
this year.</p>

<p>Many of the people of the circus accumulate
competences after a few years&#8217; work, and there is
no reason why all who live prudently should not
soon be financially independent. Their expenses of
travel, board and bed are all borne by the management,
and other requirements of a circus campaign
are few and small. It is a common practice
with some to draw only a small share of their
salaries each week. The accumulated balance
awaits them in the money wagon at the close of
the season. Then, there is the &#8220;mother&#8221; of the
circus with whom many of the unmarried men and
the boys deposit a weekly stipend. No plea, however
piteous, will force her to disgorge, they
know, until the last stand has been played. Then
the amassed wealth is handed to them with a
parting kindly injunction to be moderate through
the winter and return next year with as much
unspent as consistent. This interest in his welfare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
has started many a circus man on the road to
prosperity and fortune.</p>

<p>The &#8220;mother&#8221; is one of the most interesting
characters of the circus. Her life is devoted particularly
to the welfare of the woman performers
under tents. Her official duty is as matron of the
women&#8217;s dressing-room. She it is who supervises
their wardrobe, mends sudden breaches in the
tarlatan and bespangled skirts and cares for her
charges in case of illness or accident. Should an
equestrienne fall from her horse, it is the &#8220;circus
mother&#8221; who brings the cup of black coffee, which
is the only stimulant ever given to gymnasts and
acrobats in such an emergency.</p>

<p>At night, after the performance, she presides over
the performers&#8217; luncheon of sandwiches and tea,
which the circus women enjoy in the sleeping car.
In short, she is a general chaperon, hospital
nurse, friend and counsellor in one. Our
&#8220;mother&#8217;s&#8221; long experience in circus life has made
her familiar with every detail of the business and
she knows what to do, without any prompting,
whenever any emergency arises. Men and women
alike come to her with the petty troubles that are
bound to occur in the uncertain and strenuous
existence they lead. She is cheery, sympathetic or
admonitory as the occasion may require, and no
one leaves her presence without being the better
for having come into contact with the motherly
matron. It is an axiom among circus people that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the good-will of the &#8220;mother&#8221; is equivalent to
lasting favor with the management, and that to
incur her ill-will is to stand an imminent risk of
losing an engagement.</p>

<p>A large part of her duty is the care of the circus
wardrobe, and during the winter she devotes her
entire time to it. With her deft fingers and the
judicious use of naphtha she makes old circus costumes
look like new. Trappings which are worn
by the animals in the grand entry are all made
by the &#8220;mother&#8221; and her assistants during the
idle winter season. She is as expert at cutting a
pattern for the costumes of the animals as a
Fifth avenue modiste is at cutting those for her
smart clientele. She is, in short, the Worth of
circusland. Although nearly sixty years old, she
is as lively as a woman half her age.</p>

<p>The domestic instinct is very strong among the
circus women for the reason that they are deprived
of home life, a great part of every year. It
finds an outlet in many little ways, one of which
is an appeal to the chef in charge of the dining
car to be allowed to bake a cake. If he is in a
mood to give them permission they are pleased as
children, and begin a hunt for eggs and milk.
The train may be standing just outside of some
village, and they run out and buy the things and
come back and cook as though it were the greatest
fun in the world. When their cake or pie is
done, it is passed through the car, and no matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
how small it may be, there is always a bit for
everyone. Sometimes the cook is ill-tempered and
won&#8217;t let them fuss around, but that doesn&#8217;t
always stop them. It isn&#8217;t at all unusual for
them to go to one of the houses along near the
track and ask the woman who lives there to let
them use her kitchen. Almost always they get
permission and afterwards pay for it.</p>

<p>They sew, too, and many do exceedingly pretty
fancy work. They don&#8217;t have to keep their circus
clothes in order. The &#8220;circus mother&#8221; does that,
but they do all the mending of personal garments,
and besides keep some sort of pickup work on
hand. There isn&#8217;t a home of a circus woman that
is not furnished with the covers of some sort she
has made during the season. One seldom sees a
circus woman in a city after the season is over.
She flees from it. She detests the noise and bustle,
and, almost without exception, they all live in
little country towns, where they practise during
the winter, go early to bed and are in fine condition
when the season opens.</p>

<p>I know that it is a common thing to believe
that a circus woman has no modesty, but the
impression is a mistaken one. She can dress as
she does and perform, and still be a perfectly
good, pure woman. That is because no town has
any identity to her, nor any person any individuality.
It makes no difference to her whether the
show is in New York City or Kalamazoo. There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
simply a performance to be given, and she is not
playing to any one person. There is no &#8220;he&#8221; in
the audience who may be attracted to take her
out to supper afterwards. He wouldn&#8217;t have the
chance to speak to her, if he wanted to, and if she
seems to him an earth-born fairy, she never knows
it. No women could live more protected lives.
The performance isn&#8217;t over until eleven o&#8217;clock,
and all must be in the cars of the circus train by
midnight, when the cars are usually locked for the
night; and when one remembers that a circus
woman is almost invariably married, and that
her husband is with her, it can be appreciated
that the moral standard of the profession is high.
Most of the circus women support families, and
their leisure between performances is spent in
sewing&mdash;perhaps garments for younger children at
home, or, as a matter of economy, for themselves;
for they save every possible penny, finding incentive
and practical aid in the fact that they need
not consider the expense of living in the necessary
outlay.</p>

<p>After the night performance, they return to their
private cars, which are by that time prepared to
start for another town as soon as the tents and
other paraphernalia are aboard. Week after week
of this routine, as regularly carried out as the
work of a factory, requires physical stamina as
well as the actual gymnastic or acrobatic circus
faculty, for which a clear brain is the most requisite.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
These things are not maintained except by
regular living. The motto of the circus acrobat,
therefore, might be &#8220;plain living and high jumping.&#8221;
Beneath the white canvas, as under the
brick and iron of city office buildings, there is no
room for those who complain. &#8220;Headaches&#8221; and
similar excuses for a non-appearance must for disciplinary
reasons be frowned upon by the equestrian
director&mdash;the stage manager of the circus.
It is the &#8220;circus mother&#8221; who pleads with him to
excuse the women who are not able to appear.
She it is to whom they go with griefs and complaints
and upon whose sympathy in their concern
they may rely.</p>

<p>Frivolity, even in the innocuous guise of a waiting
maid, is discouraged in circus life, and no
woman performer, be she ever so celebrated, is
allowed to carry a handmaiden to aid in dressing
her. &#8220;No room for &#8217;em,&#8221; is the terse but eloquent
excuse of the management.</p>

<p>Circuses of the better class look after the welfare
of their woman performers with a surprising regard
to detail. They are provided with a special
car in which they live while on the road, except
when the show plays a three-night or week&#8217;s
stand; in that case they are quartered in a hotel.
How very comfortable their travelling quarters
may be they are nevertheless pleased when an opportunity
is had to spend a few days in a room
which affords sufficient space to allow of unpacking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and repacking trunks, for in one-night stands
the trunk containing personal belongings is never
moved except from car to lot. Woman riders frequently
own their own horses. It is indeed considered
a breach of circus etiquette, or more particularly
speaking a lowering of one&#8217;s &#8220;caste&#8221; to
be content to ride an animal owned by some one
else. The sharp little vibrant &#8220;clucks,&#8221; with which
the equestrienne commands her horse in the ring,
are &#8220;cues&#8221; which he understands as well as he
does the swaying of the ringmaster&#8217;s whip from
left to right, or the pressure of his rider&#8217;s satin
slipper. Each of these is a suggestion to his
memory that brings instant response in some
change of movement.</p>

<p>The disadvantage under which a circus woman
&#8220;makes up&#8221; would drive an actress to despair.
She sits upon a small stool before the stationary
mirror in the upraised lid of the trunk, and
&#8220;makes up&#8221; as best she can in the big dressing
tent. There are perhaps thirty other women in
the tent, and a wardrobe mistress in charge, prepared
to mend suddenly acquired rents in emergencies.
The use of alcohol for spirit lamps is not
allowed unless with a special permit from the
&#8220;mother.&#8221; Many of the woman acrobats, gymnasts
and jugglers are foreign. They have homes
abroad, perhaps, and work industriously in leisure
hours to beautify them. One woman who travelled
last season with us completed during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
tour an entire bed set of renaissance lace, cover
and pillow shams. This same woman who is one
of a troupe of acrobats, when twitted for her
&#8220;stinginess,&#8221; was wont to reply: &#8220;Well, it is another
brick in my house&mdash;very dollar I save.&#8221;
She was buying a home for her mother and sister.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_136f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">PRACTISING TRICKS IN THE OPEN.</p>

<p>Any one who witnesses the performance of these
professional female athletes must marvel at the
strength, skill and endurance that a woman is
capable of. There are on both sides of the Atlantic
more than two thousand women who earn
their living in this way, and of these nearly one
half are found in America. They like the West
best; for they tell you the Westerner is the most
ardent admirer of muscle and nerve as displayed
by the gentler sex. The women like their business.
They have no special dietary. They eat when they
feel like it; eat heartily, too, and of anything they
crave. Their remuneration varies from fifty to
one hundred and fifty dollars a week. The best of
them and, of course, the few, command the latter
sum.</p>

<p>A woman performer with whom I talked one
afternoon gave it as her opinion that women are
more proficient as animal trainers than men. She
said: &#8220;One need not seek far for a reason for
this. In the first place, women are more patient,
and it is quite a mistaken idea to suppose that
rough methods are necessary in training animals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
One sees many more woman animal trainers
abroad than in this country, but a number of
them have been celebrated in the United States.
I think it is the mother instinct in women which
enables them to command the obedience of animals.
It is a well-known fact among circus people
that monkeys are particularly fond of women.
Horses, too, are readily trained by women.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some years ago I trained successfully a number
of sheep, supposedly the stupidest of animals. I
cannot say that I found them overweaningly intelligent,
but with much patience, the virtue which
I insist makes a woman capable as an animal
trainer, I succeeded in teaching them a series of
tricks both original and clever, such as are usually
performed by a dog circus. Dogs and horses have
the best memories, though some trainers contend
that the elephant has. A dog or horse will respond
to a nod or the slightest swaying motion
of a whip from side to side. Elephants, being
more ponderous of body, naturally require more
time to train.&#8221;</p>

<p>Few people distinguish between the gymnasts
and acrobats of a circus, yet there is a distinction
with a decided difference. The acrobat is he who
tumbles and turns somersaults, and usually
&#8220;starts the show&#8221; by running from a springboard
and jumping over the wide backs of elephants
in line. The gymnast is an aerial artist,
and his work has little in common with that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the other performer. Some people, according to
an authority on circus matters, are born with a
balance. Presence of mind has not only to be a
habit but an exact science, as it were, with the
man or woman performer who would master the
art of the flying ring. This is one of the reasons
for the abstemiousness of the circus fraternity.
No drugs or alcohol are permitted inside the circus
tent. This is a law the violation of which means
inevitable dismissal for any performer. Perhaps
the very obvious necessity for its enforcement is
at the same time the reason why it is so seldom
broken. Performers must needs be springy of
step, clear of head, keen of eye and sound of
liver.</p>

<p>Perhaps few in a circus audience who have many
times admired the graceful gesticulations of the
tight rope and slack rope walkers realize the
utility of the small Japanese umbrella which they
wield with apparently careless grace. As a matter
of fact, the umbrella and other paraphernalia
thrown to them by the attendants and which
they manipulate for no apparent reason save
that of adding effectiveness to the act, are in reality
used for balancing purposes. Many a wire walker
has been saved from perhaps fatal accident by a
dexterous swerving of the light parasol from right
to left, readjusting the balance just in the nick of
time.</p>

<p>Most of the circuses abroad are enclosed indoor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
affairs, and as the buildings in which such attractions
are seen are of much greater height than
anything we have in this country, the opportunity
for daring gymnastic acts is far greater than here.
At the Crystal Palace, the Olympia and the
Royal Aquarium and also at the Alhambra, many
feats are performed which it would be impossible
to duplicate here. Children are oftener seen as
acrobats and gymnasts in the old country than in
America. They begin to train as early as three
years of age and many tots of six and seven are
wonderfully accomplished circus performers, in
lands where the Children&#8217;s Society holds not
sway. These children are in many instances apprenticed
out to old performers who train them,
and are repaid in return by their services for a
certain number of years.</p>

<p>Few of the members of the so-called acrobatic
families bear any individual relationship to one
another, and the name taken by the troupe
is usually that of the trainer or leading acrobat.</p>

<p>Of late years costumes for acrobats have
changed considerably. It used to be the fashion
to wear tights and blouses which would be as
little impedimental as possible to the free swing of
the body. Now, however, the latest acrobatic
actors imported from Europe are affecting evening
dress, the women in decollete gowns, full-skirted,
and the men in the black and white habiliments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
prescribed by convention for dress occasions. Needless
to say it is much more difficult for both men
and women to perform acrobatic feats thus attired,
but the fashions of the circus world like
those of society are inexorable.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more incongruous than the
devotion existing between our French animal
trainer and his performing grizzly bear. The
animal is the largest of the bear species and the
most powerful and formidable, yet this owner has
taught his specimen gentleness and good manners.
He is its constant companion and attendant. Its
long and shaggy brown coat is brushed and
combed at frequent intervals, and food is proffered
in bare outstretched hands. It obeys commands
with all the sagacity of a well-trained dog and
gives an exhibition of wrestling, pugilism and
other difficult displays which interest and amuse.
Its enormous paws and long sharp claws are a
menace against which pads and gloves sometimes
avail nothing and the foreigner is ever a sorely
wounded person. Bruin has been elevated to a
state of intelligence which seems to give him keen
enjoyment of bear humor. Thus it is that the
circus folks declare that whenever the beast slaps
or hugs its human friend with unusual violence,
great glee is depicted in every characteristic. No
matter how the resentful trainer exerts himself, he
cannot retaliate with any effect. The sight of the
Frenchman chattering angrily at the unconcerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
furry humorist after their performance is a weekly
source of merriment in the menagerie tent.</p>

<p>The &#8220;rooster man&#8221; is one of the novelties of the
show and of the dressing-room. He is an Englishman
who costumes himself like a monstrous fighting
cock, gaffed and ready for the fray, and astonishes
the audience with an exhibition in which
an audacious little natural game cock participates.
It concludes with a battle between the pseudo and
the genuine bird in which the one engages eagerly
and is impressed with an exultant, strutting conviction
of victory when its huge antagonist flops
fluttering to the ground. The diversion is as entertaining
as any in the sawdust precincts and to
the show persons the most remarkable for patience
in training and endurance in execution. How little
the onlookers imagine that after the act the
human rooster frequently drops in a state of collapse
and exhaustion! The feathers which envelop
him are of necessity fastened to stiff and
smothering supports, and their encumbering
weight on a hot day is tremendous. This is one
of the secrets of the arena which probably no one
who has witnessed the unique performance ever
divined.</p>

<p>For intrepid bravery and wild exploits I doubt
if the equal of the trick bicyclist can be found.
In the parade, the chances of injury he gleefully
assumes fill the sightseer with horror and dread.
Under the canvas the greater the risk the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
enjoyment it accords him. He rides, in one exhibition,
down an ordinary ladder which stretches
to the dome of the tent. Down the smooth rungs
he dashes, like a spectral flash, and his comrades
wonder what the final end will be. Nothing can
prevent the feat. When wet weather makes other
performers hesitate or they are directed not to
try their acts, he mounts merrily to his perch and
trusts to luck and skill. Water drips from the
apparatus and his mad flight seems impossible of
safe accomplishment. He emerges unscathed.
He is, too, the dare-devil of the &#8220;cycle whirl,&#8221; a cup-shaped
apparatus made of wooden slats. He has
four companions, but the neck-breaking scorching
is delegated to him. Around the inclined track he
rushes, with hands spread out and arms upraised,
the contrivance shivering and rattling. Faster
and yet faster he whizzes until he no longer looks
like a man on a bicycle; he is a blurred line
drawn around the track. Within an inch of the
rim and disaster, down the drop to the very edge
of the floor he rumbles with no power of guidance
over his machine save his wonderful balance,
and spectators catch their breath. Then a wild
jump and he is bowing and smiling in the centre
of the cup.</p>

<p>The invention of new acts engages the attention
of acrobats and gymnasts most of the winter.
Many of them rehearse in the gymnasiums of
large cities, although aerial performers have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
difficulty in finding sufficiently ample quarters.
They tell, in dressing-room conversation, of many
queer experiences with the flabby-muscled, hollow-chested
men who seek their aid and advice to
attain better physical condition, and find much
amusement in relating their observation of
methods employed in this effort. A very rich
weakling who patronizes one of the New York
city gymnasiums is a never-ending source of hilarious
reminiscence. He is ridiculous in all his body-building
plans, but firm in his belief in their efficacy.
One of his practices is to run for hours
with a bag of shot tied to his head. He has
persuaded himself that it will develop and
strengthen his chest!</p>

<p>It is in the knees that the evidences of age first
manifest themselves in the acrobats. The strain
on this part of the body is always intense. Suddenly
the veteran finds accustomed life and spring
have left them. Then he knows the end of his active
career has come. Many of these men, barred
physically from somersaults and the like, become
&#8220;understanders,&#8221; that is, they are the members of
troupes who catch and support their twisting
comrades who alight on shoulder or ground.
Their strength is still in shoulder and arm, but
agility is a wistful memory.</p>

<p>Circus rehearsals are delayed until two or three
days before the formal opening, which affords
ample time for guaranteeing a smooth performance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
The reason that no more preliminary time
is required is due to the fact that each performer
appears for the season&#8217;s work perfect in his individual
act. There remains only the necessity for
blending into a harmonious whole. Minor details
are speedily adjusted by the equestrian director.
The celerity with which intelligent order is evolved
from chaos is amazing to the inexperienced observer.</p>

<p>The pretty and pleasant and picturesque part of
daily life under canvas comes after the substantial
meal at five o&#8217;clock, when for two hours there is
rest for all save the hard worked side-show establishment.
The woman performers, busy with fancy
work and sewing; the men talking over the gossip
of the ring; the children playing among themselves,
and with the pet ponies, form a charming
picture on the greensward back of the tents.
Down from the southern hills steals the softly
descending darkness, swift shadows move through
the lingering twilight across the big tent and
hang about the lot, and color comes into the
white moon above. A breeze, long desired and
grateful, sweeps through the place. Naphtha
torches flare as the wind blows them about. Inside
the &#8220;big top,&#8221; the long stretches of seats
barren of spectators, the equestrian director is disciplining
an obstinate &#8220;cake walking&#8221; horse; the
cycle sextet perfect a new pose; the clown is acting
as ringmaster, while his wife rehearses her riding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
act, and ten gymnasts in the high white dome
of the canvas plan more breath-taking aerial
flights. Suddenly the shrill shriek of a whistle, a
scampering to dressing-rooms, ushers in place and
the evening audience pours into the seats.</p>

CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>NIGHT SCENES AND EMBARKATION</small></h2></div>


<p>Active preparations for the departure from town
begin with the setting of the sun. When the naphtha
torches spread their fluttering glow and when
the men in the ticket wagon lift up its end and
are ready for the evening sale, then canvasman,
driver and porter swarm from the comfort of hay
couch or from idling group, and are ready for the
night&#8217;s work. Team horses feel again the weight
of harness, and the march to the railroad yards is
on. Horse, cook, wardrobe, blacksmith, barber
and the other tents spread over the lot drop to
earth, are quickly rolled up and packed away.
The sound of loading stakes, chains, ropes and
poles resounds through the premises. Heavy
wagons are soon rumbling through the streets
and left convenient to the man at the cars. Then
the teamster, returning leisurely to the lot, finds
his second vehicle awaiting final transfer.</p>

<p>Ten minutes after the performance has begun,
there is a scattering of the executive force at the
main tent entrance and the canvasmen take
possession. The ropes and stakes holding in position
the marquee and menagerie tent are loosened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
and the doorkeeper moves to the open fly in the
big tent, called the back door. The evening exhibition
programme is arranged with the view to
finishing with the trained animals as soon as possible
that they may be placed safely away for the
night. So it is that the elephants, camels, zebra,
ponies and other led animals are off with measured
tread for the cars before the show is well under
way. Then cages are closed, horses hitched, side
walls lowered and the caravan passes out into the
night. The order &#8220;lower away!&#8221; rings sharply,
and the menagerie tent drops with a heavy puff
and sigh. The denuded centre poles follow it to
the ground and, where a few hours before was a
white encampment is now a dark, bare area, rutted
with wheels, trodden by many feet and littered
with peanut shells and sawdust. Only
the noisy &#8220;big top,&#8221; glowing like a mammoth
mushroom, and the side-show canvas, where the
band thumps and the &#8220;barkers&#8221; roar with tireless
energy, remain to mark the spot. The work of
stripping the larger tent continues throughout the
performance. As fast as a performer finishes his
act his appliance is deftly conveyed to a waiting
wagon. The entire arena has been divested of its
maze and mass of apparatus before the audience
have reached the open. They stare in amazement
at the changed scene, as revealed in the lights and
shadows of the torches. So expeditious and so
smooth has been the work of the circus men that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
no knowledge of the magnitude of the accomplishment
was conveyed to the crowd inside. The side-show
orators receive the outgoing throng with
renewed clamorings. To take this last advantage
and let no chance for profit escape, the tent has
been kept open. The inmates yawn with the
weariness and monotony of it all and eagerly
await their last call to the front. Then begins a
dash for the freedom and privacy which has been
denied them since morning.</p>

<p>In the &#8220;big top&#8221; the concert band is fiddling
valiantly and a woman in skirts tries to raise her
voice above the noise of falling wood and stentorian
command. Workmen are lugging the seats
away, and tugging at ropes and stakes. The side-walls
peel off as the last spectator emerges and
performers hurry from their dressing-room. Then
the thin white cloth roof comes tumbling from
above like a monster bird; the encampment is no
more. Through dark, deserted, silent streets the
last man and wagon make their way. Nothing is
left behind in the hurried leave taking. Everything
large and small must be individually accounted
for by its custodian.</p>

<p>At the railroad yards the blazing torches show
a picturesque, animated spectacle. Here again
orderly precision prevails. The wagons are drawn
on to the cars by horses and a block and tackle,
while a man guides the course of the vehicle by its
pole as it is passed to the far end of the car.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
There is a &#8220;skid&#8221; or inclined plane at the end of
the first car, and an iron plate bridges the space
between the other cars, making a continuous
platform. Each wagon has its number and allotted
place again, and is placed to the best advantage
for convenience of unloading and for
utilizing space. A wrongly-packed vehicle would
cause endless confusion and delay. It is seldom
later than one o&#8217;clock when the three sections are
on the move. Rain and mud annoy and retard,
sometimes, but extra efforts nullify, in a great
measure, the effect of their presence. Working-man
and beast are slumbering deeply when the
engines couple for the journey, and only the watch-men,
patrolling the long stretches of cars, give
sign of life and wakefulness. At one end of the
line of Pullman sleepers, where are placed the performers
and members of the business staff, is the
most ornate piece of rolling stock, the Thelma,
named for the general manager&#8217;s daughter, a tot
who is eagerly awaiting her father&#8217;s winter cessation
from toil. Here is a queer little lunch room
where gather each evening, for a bite, after the
show, the men and boys of the circus. An hour
or two passes with much laughter and jollity and
with many innocent jokes, intermingled with serious
discussion. Ice-cream is the popular dish, and
plateful after plateful vanishes down dusty
throats. The frozen mixture is a nightly requisite
of the body-weary circus colony. It is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
them what the night cap of liquor represents to
the toper. No headache or clouded brain or dulled
body is its concomitant, only health-giving properties.
Strong drink is tabooed in the Thelma, as
is its fate elsewhere with the circus, and no demand
for its presence has ever been manifested.
The scene is one the most approved moralist
would endorse.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_150f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">PERFORMERS AT THEIR MIDDAY MEAL.</p>

<p>Hassan Ali, the giant of the side-show, is the
most unwelcome visitor. Room is at a premium,
and he occupies about double space. Somebody is
always stepping on his protruding feet, to his intense
disgust, but to the ill-concealed amusement
of the others. There is a general feeling of impending
disaster when Hassan is seen stooping
into the room. If his huge bulk doesn&#8217;t shatter a
chair, his awkward movements seldom fail to
break a dish, crush a by-stander or scatter food
indiscriminately. Colonel Seely, the privilege man,
grumbles vigorously, and none of us are at ease
until the giant has retired to bed and the nightly
ordeal is over. Through it all Hassan never loses
his temper or composure. His good nature knows
no bounds.</p>

<p>A veteran of the ring tells of railroad accidents
and other circus disasters and reverts to the days
of P. T. Barnum. &#8220;That man certainly had his
troubles,&#8221; he observes. &#8220;His pecuniary catastrophes
and fiery ordeals would have utterly discouraged
a man less stout-hearted than he. Three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
times his museums were burned to the ground.
The number thirteen he always considered ominous,
for the first of his buildings was consumed
on that day of the month, while the thirteenth
day of November saw the opening of the second
establishment, which was likewise subsequently
destroyed by fire. On July 13, 1865, while he was
speaking in the Connecticut legislature at Hartford,
the American Museum was consumed. Nothing
remained but the smouldering debris when he
arrived in New York. It had been probably the
most attractive place of resort and entertainment
in the United States. Here were burned up the
accumulated results of many years of incessant
toil in gathering from every quarter of the globe
myriads of curious productions of art and nature.
The indefatigable showman immediately began
the erection of new buildings at Nos. 535, 537
and 539 Broadway, New York, and started a new
chapter in his career. The place was levelled by
flames in March, 1868, completely frustrating his
plans for the future. The loss did not disturb his
tranquillity and he established a &#8220;museum, menagerie
and hippodrome&#8221; in Fourteenth street.
Four weeks after the opening, it, too, was ablaze
and no effort could prevent its total loss.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire did not, either, confine its devouring
presence to his professional enterprises. On December
18, 1857, his home, &#8216;Iranistan,&#8217; at Bridgeport,
became the prey of flames. His assignees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
sold the grounds to Elias Howe, Jr., inventor of
the sewing machine, for fifty thousand dollars,
which went toward satisfying the Barnum creditors,
for the showman was at that time in one of
his periodical financial difficulties, from which,
however, he finally extricated himself. His faculty
for making money always successfully asserted
itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was in his employ for many years and wonder
that I escaped alive. I was in a dozen crashes
on the railroad, and was in Bridgeport both times
the winter quarters were swept by flames. Fire
first came in 1887 and destroyed the main building.
The white elephant and two others, Alice
and Sampson, were burned, and nearly all the
other animals except a rhinoceros, one lion and a
white polar bear, perished. The blaze was of incendiary
origin, for the watchman told me he saw
a man coming down the outside stairs of the
paint shop and a few moments later was struck
on the head from behind and knocked down.
Immediately after, the fire burst out and illuminated
the horizon for miles around. The flames
spread so rapidly that the firemen could do nothing
more than save the adjoining buildings, cars
and wagons. The rhinoceros made his escape
through a window but was so badly burned that
he died. An elephant came as far as the door of
the building, then turned back into the flames.
Alice and Sampson also made an attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
escape. One large lion ran out into the yard and
the spectators fled in all directions. It took refuge
behind a car and a policeman fired several shots
into his body. This partially disabled him and a
keeper succeeded in caging him. Many of the
museum and menagerie curiosities were in the
burned building and were destroyed. One of the
engines on the way to the fire was stopped by a
large elephant on the streets. There was a panic
among the people and they tumbled over each
other trying to get out of the way. An escaped
tiger also caused a great commotion. The elephant
trainer was out of town and the other
keepers were unable to quiet the frightened animals.
Thirty of the elephants and one large lion
started across the country in the direction of
Fairfield and Easton, scattering the people right
and left. It was several days before they were all
recaptured.</p>

<p>&#8220;The other fire was in 1898 when Barnum was
dead and the show was in Europe. The loss was
one hundred thousand dollars. We got most of
the animals stored there out safely. Fifty green
horses, I remember, broke from their stalls and
ran mad through the streets. The townspeople
were pretty frightened, for they thought some of
the wild beasts were loose.&#8221;</p>

<p>The husband of &#8220;the mother of the circus&#8221;
drops in for a sandwich. His wife has retired,
longing for the happiness of all and full of plans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
to promote it. He has been twitting the unicycle
performer because the latter&#8217;s wonderful feat has
been made almost insignificant by comparison
with the &#8220;loop-the-loop&#8221; accomplishment. The
equilibrist retorts that for next season he has
arranged an act that will discount anything ever
seen under tent. He proposes to hoist the &#8220;cycle
whirl&#8221; apparatus thirty feet from the ground and
ride on its track with nothing between him and
earth. There is a general protest that he hasn&#8217;t
the nerve or skill; but he smiles knowingly.</p>

<p>The discussion turns to feats of agility; it is
agreed that the tight rope walker is the best
tumbler with the show. The clown laments because
he hasn&#8217;t received the usual daily letter
from the little woman he married in New York in
the spring. The equestrian director tells of the
circus as it used to be, and all enjoy his stories.
One of the trick bicyclist&#8217;s arms is in a sling; he
had a bad fall during the evening performance.
The family of Italian acrobats jabber tirelessly in
the corner; they know nothing of our language,
but their superior skill commands a big salary.
A somersault rider dashes in after a sandwich for
his wife, with whom he does a carrying act. The
Japanese juggler and his son retire together; they
are never apart. There is a laugh at the expense
of the two horizontal bar performers who lost
their way in the sombre village streets and were
an hour in finding the car. A partial exodus begins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
when the word goes forth that the first section
is ready to move. Those whose berths are
on one of the other divisions bid good-night. So
the scene and its actors shift. At midnight or
soon after, the Thelma lunch-room is deserted, save
for the busy porter. Dusty clothes and shoes
that show inconsiderate treatment occupy his
time until the yawning cook appears. Then the
delicious odor of coffee pervades the quarters, and
breakfast food awaits the hearty order of hungry
men. They are far removed from the scene of a
few hours before and gaze curiously at the surroundings.
To-morrow morning the setting will
be new and strange again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">
CHAPTER X<br />

<small>THE CIRCUS DETECTIVE</small></h2></div>


<p>To the circus organization with honest purpose
the problem of dealing with the horde of &#8220;guns,&#8221;
&#8220;dips,&#8221; &#8220;grafters&#8221; and others of their criminal
ilk, who would fain be its daily companion, is
perplexing and formidable. Next season the duty
of protecting the person and pocket of our patrons
will be a duty entrusted to new hands. Frank
Smoot, for many years the circus detective, is
resting a long sleep in an Illinois graveyard. A
hemorrhage took his life as the circus was folding
itself away for the winter. The record of his acts
and his virtues will ever be inscribed upon the
fleshly tablets of our hearts.</p>

<p>No person was ever more thoroughly equipped
by nature and experience for the hidden but tremendously
valuable part he played in the daily
life with the circus. It was confidently averred of
him that he was familiar with the figure, face and
method of almost every crook in the circus world.
No person of doubtful or dishonest purpose could
remain for more than a few hours in company
with the circus without being singled out and
summarily dealt with. The treatment varied materially.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Its mildness or ferocity rested entirely
with the wicked one&#8217;s conduct after he received the
order that he take quick passage out of vision
and return no more.</p>

<p>Mr. Smoot possessed great coolness of nerve and
quickness of hand and eye. In the smaller cities
his appearance at the local police station was almost
simultaneous with the arrival of the circus
train. He found, generally, a commander whose
criminal experience had been confined to the
peaceful country borders, who was entirely unaware
whether or not the community had been
invaded by those who would profit by the lack of
worldly knowledge of the thousands of show-day
visitors, and whose precautions consisted of the
swearing in of numerous deputies, who wore conspicuously
a bright badge of office in the happy
assurance that it would permit them free entrance
to the tent. But the police chief was always alive
to the responsibilities of his position, offered aid,
if not advice, and was ready to act when his duty
was pointed out.</p>

<p>Then the circus detective hurried to the railroad
station and scrutinized the passengers on all incoming
trains. Here he sometimes found the
railroad watchdog. Many of the big railroads
send their detectives wherever the circus uses their
lines. Their aim is to see to it that those who
patronize their service do so at no financial
risk. The peripatetic crook is quickly given to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
understand that he must use other means to
travel.</p>

<p>The thick crowds which awaited the coming of the
parade was the next scene of Mr. Smoot&#8217;s activity.
Here was frequently uncovered the first prey of the
day, and seldom a morning passed that at least
one cunning lawbreaker did not feel the weight of
a heavy hand on his shoulder, and hear, sullenly,
the word to march to the police station and undergo
the damp solitude of a county jail cell for
twenty-four hours. Then, when the circus was
miles away on its course, he passed out to freedom.
Where were yesterday the throng of sightseers,
which had filled him with promise of great
profit, were only the trodden peanut shells and the
accustomed monotony of the country town. The
venturesome crook who invaded the circus lot
proper, was an especial object of vigilance. Sometimes
Mr. Smoot stood for hours on the top of
the ticket wagon, a stalwart figure outlined above
the crowds, watching for his professional enemies,
where he could see on every hand; again he was
at the main entrance with a steady, critical survey
of all who passed under the broad spread of
canvas.</p>

<p>A promise made to him in good faith by a
crook had never been broken, he used to say. I
remember an interesting demonstration I witnessed
of his confidence in the word of a man to
whom no crime was unfamiliar. He had been discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
loitering about the grounds, and had been
ordered off with a threat of immediate arrest. He
resembled much a country gentleman of ample
means and genial nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you got me quick,&#8221; was his ready remark,
&#8220;but seeing as I came all the way from
Pittsburg and can&#8217;t catch a train back until
night, won&#8217;t you let me see the show? I pledge
you I won&#8217;t do any &#8216;business,&#8217; no matter how
tempted.&#8221;</p>

<p>His ingenuous request was granted with a feeling
of security in his word by the detective, which the
day showed was not misplaced.</p>

<p>The work of the circus detective, which calls for
all his shrewdness and courage is in dealing with
the dangerous, determined characters who disregard
the warning to part company with the show
at once, and who rejoin the organization as soon
as released from a preceding day behind bars;
men of plausible manners and engaging address
who are ready for any desperate chance. Upon
these recalcitrants swift retribution is visited.
Formidable machinery which exercises a vague
and terrible power is put in motion. And thus it
is that the moon, rising over a country district,
sometimes shines on the circus train speeding on
its journey, and its clear rays stream over a deserted
lot, casting strange shadows from a figure
which lies as it has fallen, huddled in an ungainly
heap upon the wet grass. Dawn brings animation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
to the form and to a hardened criminal a feeling
of thanksgiving that he is still alive, and a deep
conviction that hereafter his world of &#8220;graft&#8221; will
be far removed from the circus and its primitive
punishment.</p>

<p>The personality of circus men has changed materially
for the better in recent years. Time was
when they invariably wore high silk hats and
clothes of many checks and hues. To be without
diamonds on fingers and in shirt and necktie was
a standing reproach to the profession. Nowadays
the circus man affects little jewelry, and that unobtrusive,
or none, and in his attire and speech he
differs none from the man of ordinary commercial
pursuits. He has established a reputation for
honesty and sobriety and is an element of order
and decency. He surrounds himself with associates
of good character and business integrity, and
cherishes highly his good standing in the community.</p>

<p>The increased police vigilance and protection
accorded has helped to bring about this happy
condition of affairs. In the past it was often
necessary to save life and property by meeting the
attacks of roughs and rowdies with equal violence
and disorder. Circuses expected and received
little or no help from supine or frightened police,
and learned to fight their own battles. It has
never been charged that any circus was not fully
capable of meeting force with force, and the lawless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
affrays of the circus lot would form a bloody
narrative. No show in the old days dared venture
forth without a squad of picked fighters, and if
the occasion demanded the whole encampment was
eager and ready for the fray. The war cry &#8220;Hey
Rube!&#8221; had forceful significance then. The circus
man&#8217;s favorite weapon was the guy stake, a shaft
of wood used to support chains and ropes. An
iron ring circled one end, the other was pointed
enough to penetrate the hardest ground. Wielded
by brawny workmen, experienced in its manipulation
and skilled by long practice in the art of
rough combat, the instrument mowed down the
ranks of the enemy with deadly execution. Fists,
knives and pistols availed nothing against the
onslaught. Fear and mercy were unknown in
those lawless times.</p>

<p>Years ago if murder was done the guilt was not
always fixed upon the circus employee. The hasty
concealment of a body in the hay behind the cages
in the menagerie tent temporarily hid evidence of
the crime. In the darkness of the departure, there
was a surreptitious burial. The lifeless form was
hastily conveyed under ground where had been the
circus ring and where the chances of discovery and
disinterment were remote. Many a victim of savage
circus warfare rests in these unmarked graves,
and pick and shovel would solve the mystery investing
scores of circus day disappearances. Particularly
in the Southern States, soon after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
war, were these sanguinary battles waged and
with fatal results. In justice to the circus men,
let it be said that their consciences gave no reproof
and they felt no sense of moral guilt for the
reason that they were never the instigators of
riot, that they strove to quell trouble in its incipient
stages and that they fought for their lives
and their employer&#8217;s property. They knew, too,
that public prejudice would prevent a fair legal
trial and saw to it, if human ingenuity could prevail,
that no serious charge could be laid against
them, much less that of homicide.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A CIRCUS HORSE</small></h2></div>


<p>When the circus bill posters swarmed over the
farm a month ago and garnished my stable with
products of their pot and brush, a shadow of
sadness and melancholy oppressed me. Curiosity
urged me to approach, but a sense of mortification
over my ignominious fate bade me restrain
myself. I kept in seclusion under a distant apple-tree
and hoped to escape detection. However, I
was doomed to disappointment, for soon I observed
my owner, whom I detest, coming with
halter and whip. Then I knew that he had revealed
my identity to the showmen and they had
expressed a desire to view me. At first I was disinclined
to enter their presence, but the master
cornered me and adjusted straps, despite my protestations.
How shameful a spectacle, Tom Keene,
who made for himself, at home and abroad, a
place among the greatest horses in circus history,
being led by a New Hampshire farmer&mdash;for the vulgar
scrutiny of a group of cheap posters!</p>

<p>They inspected me with many evidences of interest,
although I am convinced I would not have
been recognized had not one of the visitors called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
attention to a scar on my flank and recalled the
incident of a train wreck in which it was received.
Then I remembered him as one of the stable men
of my professional career. He called me by name
and stroked me tenderly, but I was too ashamed
at my position to respond to his greetings. He
handed the master an order for circus seats and I
felt more miserable. I knew it was inevitable that
my old comrades spy me hitched to the old carry-all,
along with the nags of the neighborhood, as
they paraded by amid the joyous flourish of trumpets
and proud and plumed. I loathed myself in
the contemplation.</p>

<p>The succeeding days were a period of dismal
foreboding. Adding to my sorrows and regret
was the scarlet paper which confronted me when I
entered the stable. It depicted the performance of
one &#8220;Senator,&#8221; a low-born pony, of whom I had
a vague memory. He had displaced me with my
associate of many years, Frank J. Melville. He
was represented in all sorts of accomplishments,
which I secretly feared were really carried out. A
wave of emotion and sentiment overcame me
whenever I permitted myself to gaze at the familiar
figure of the man. My mind reverted to the
time when he was one of the champion bareback
riders and I contributed to the brilliant artistic
results. How I longed to feel his slippered feet on
my broad back, and hear again the plaudits of
onlookers! I shall always have a warm, deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
feeling for him. Perhaps, after all, he had no
other recourse than to dispense with my services.
I know he was much affected at the parting, and
exacted a promise that I should always be given
kind treatment, and that every consideration be
shown my impaired leg.</p>

<p>Instinct told me when the hateful day was at
hand. The master was up and about early and I
could hear the glad shouts of the children. I had
little appetite for the bountiful breakfast he spread
before me, and he seemed much concerned over my
want of spirit and worn appearance. I had
wasted appreciably in anxiety over the ordeal before
me and felt a faint sympathy for the man. I
appreciated that he would feel that Mr. Melville
would decide that I had not received proper care
and would be angry. For myself, I was in that
desperate condition of mind which is the recklessness
of despair.</p>

<p>I was guided, to a hitching post in the main
street of the town, where eager crowds awaited
the arrival of the parade. We were a shabby
enough outfit, the farm wagon and I, and I could
summon no interest in the scene. I heard, with
listless feeling, the master confide, boastfully, to
all who would listen, that once I had shed great
lustre upon the circus ring, and felt no humiliation
when they scoffed at his words. He seemed
to find great exultation in dwelling upon my
former renown and my downfall, and in his present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
proprietorship. I caught a glimpse of several
familiar faces in the throng, notably the circus
detective and the commissary department man,
but gave no sign of recognition. If they observed
me at all, they doubtless saw nothing not in common
with my neighbors from the rural districts.
The crowd wondered at the tardiness of the parade,
and I felt a silent contempt for their ignorance.
The cages had just passed on the way to
the lot and they come on the last section. The
man who leads the procession passed in his carriage,
inspecting and familiarizing himself with the
route. I, of all the throng, alone knew him and
his mission.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_166f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">TEACHING HER HORSE NEW TRICKS.</p>

<p>Soon the faint music of the bands and the distant
shriek of the calliope. The cortege was approaching.
I braced myself for the trying experience.
Some one shouted: &#8220;Look out for your
horses! The elephants are right behind!&#8221; A
policeman grabbed my bridle and I gazed at him,
indulgently. I afraid! I who lived for years
among them! I remembered the solemn joke of
my former loved master, who used to cry, when
the crowd wouldn&#8217;t make way: &#8220;Keep back! A
drove of loose lions are coming!&#8221; Then there had
been no further pushing; everybody scampered to
sidewalk or doorstep. I think it was the third
uniformed horseman who recalled in me their old
acquaintance. He called the attention of the rider
behind, was corroborated and then the word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
seemed to pass instantaneously back through the
parade. Some reached over and patted my sides,
others spoke words of encouragement and praise,
and all had a look of profound veneration. I
tried to look very spruce and sprightly through it
all, but candor confesses that the attempt was
a feeble imitation of the old days. My blood
stirred for the first time since I was in the foremost
circus ranks and I lamented bitterly. Oh,
for the staunch, true leg of a few years ago
and Mr. Melville on my back! Again we would
make all other performances appear commonplace.</p>

<p>The man I sought everywhere with my eyes was
not in the procession and a fear possessed me
that I might not be permitted to feel his hand
and hear his voice. But it developed that this
was farthest from my master&#8217;s thought. Up to
the circus grounds we progressed and I ambled to
the horse tents and stopped mechanically. I was
living again in former glories. Then my eyes were
blessed with the appearance of my old comrade.
How he kissed and hugged me and looked me over
critically and asked about my welfare! And how
ineffably proud and happy I was when he insisted
there was never my equal in all the requirements
of the ring, and there was none to say him nay!
I fancied there were tears in his eyes as we hopped
away toward the farm, and I gave him a last beseeching
plea for a return to the old life. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
three sound legs are as gifted, I&#8217;ll warrant, as any
four in the circus stables.</p>

<p>Thus was broken, for a little space, the dull
tenor of my sombre life. I often assure myself
that death will be brighter than the contemptuous
existence I am leading. Of one thing I am convinced,
the history of the circus can never be
written without mentioning me, the pioneer of
horses born with all the true circus instincts. I
first saw the light of day in Keene, N. H., not far
from the spot where I am passing my last days in
oblivion. I was distinguished by a strong frame,
was hardy, gentle and active, and could properly
be called handsome. Mr. James A. Bailey singled
me out when his circus came to New Hampshire,
and my career certainly justified all the prophetic
things he said about me. I was disappointed
when they attached me to the pole-wagon, but
felt confident that I would soon rise superior to
the rather humble position. The work was long
and arduous, and it was several weeks before I
became accustomed to the nocturnal train rides,
jammed erect among a score of other equines, but
I endured it better than many of my companions.
Some of them contracted a disease of the foot,
caused by continued rain and mud, and in many
cases it resulted fatally. I was patient and hopeful
through all vicissitudes and arrived at winter
quarters in physical condition that attracted
general attention. Mr. Melville happened upon me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
soon after arrival and stopped short in admiring
wonder. I knew him as a noted rider and connoisseur
of horseflesh and was much elated. Next
day Martin Welsh led me to new quarters. He
was Mr. Melville&#8217;s groom, and the delicious consciousness
came that I was in their famous hands.
Soon practice began as a ring animal and a great
future opened before me. I meditate over the
past, here in my loneliness, and wonder if mine is
not a career which no other circus animal has
equalled. Some of its striking features occur
vividly to me.</p>

<p>I remember first, with pardonable pride, that it
was generally conceded that I was the best
&#8220;broke&#8221; horse in the history of the ring. There
seemed to be a vein of harmony in the feeling
existing between Mr. Melville and myself. Nothing
ever made me nervous or shy. I trusted my master
implicitly and I was as accurate and certain
in my movements when he was turning somersaults
or leaping through fire rings or balloons as
when we made the preliminary canter. My broad,
muscular back was ever waiting for him to alight
just where he planned. Many said much of the
credit for his feats was mine. Modesty prevents
an expression on my part. We toured America a
season and were everywhere received with warm
approval. Then we set out for England. Bessie,
a fine, gray horse, also from New Hampshire, accompanied
us. She was a wonderfully intelligent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
animal, and the only horse, I understand, who
ever was trained to trot in the circus ring. She
used to circle the ring at a forty gait, with our
owner doing all sorts of tricks upon her back.
Poor girl, she died in Hamburg and I missed her
sorely for years.</p>

<p>Our itinerary, as I recall it, was about like this:
From London to Hamburg, to Russia, to Poland,
to Liverpool, to France, to Holland, to France
again, to Belgium, back to Hamburg, returning
to London and Liverpool, once more in Hamburg
and then aboard ship for our native country.
Here we visited all states and territories, toured
Mexico and passed on to Cuba. Ten years were
consumed in our travels and nowhere did we fail
to achieve emphatic success. It is a record I
contemplate with a feeling of great elation, and
which I have heard circus men say is entitled to
unique distinction. We gave eleven private matinees
before the royal family of Russia, and some
of the prominent persons who witnessed our performances
during our professional career were
Grover Cleveland, President of the United States;
the late Queen Victoria of England and her son,
the present king; the Marquis of Salisbury, prime
minister of England and the great leader in the
House of Commons; Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany
and his wife and their son, Prince Fritz; the late
Prince Von Bismarck, the &#8220;man of iron;&#8221; the late
Count Von Moltke, field marshal and chief of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
staff of the German Army, one of the world&#8217;s
greatest soldiers; President Carnot, of the French
Republic, since assassinated; Queen Emma of Holland
and her daughter, the present queen; King
Leopold of Belgium; the last three Emperors of
Russia, Alexander I., Alexander II., and Nicholas
II; and Francis Joseph, emperor of Austria, and
his accomplished wife who was later stabbed to
death. What other lowly horse ever helped to
enthrall the attention of such a galaxy of notables?</p>

<p>Many ludicrous and many sober incidents of my
eventful circus life come to my mind. I was in
many train wrecks. Once my car caught fire on
the journey from St. Petersburg to Warsaw.
There were four of us in the place and I was the
only one to escape alive. Martin Welsh, my devoted
friend, helped me to safety. Again, when
twenty-five horses were packed in one of the circus
cars in Indiana, it rolled down an embankment.
I was one of five to emerge unhurt; most of the
others had their necks broken. I remember, too,
when I was thrown with four carloads of equine
companions into the Ohio river. It happened on
a Sunday run from Cairo, Ill., to Detroit, Mich.
Many were drowned or perished from exposure. I
floated about eight hours before being rescued and
never felt any ill effects. Mr. Melville and I were
on the steamer Stork which became waterlogged
during the trip from Hamburg to England. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
were nine days at sea, and I passed most of the
time in water above my knees. I was ready for
the ring when we finally landed.</p>

<p>I am sure that I have travelled more miles in
my life than any other horse ever born and have
displayed through it all more hardihood than any,
save perhaps Mayfly, whose famous career has
been recited many times in circus camps. He
antedated me many years. They tell of his standing
trip of one hundred and ninety days from
Sydney, Australia, to Valparaiso, Chili, and his
subsequent rough overland journey to various
parts of the republic and back again to the Pacific
Ocean. Then he was taken by water to San
Francisco, a three months&#8217; trying experience, and
later around the southern continent to New York.
It was enough to wreck the finest constitution,
but he never flinched. He and his sister, Black
Bess, were of pure Arab extraction, and some of
the finest horses in California to-day date their
parentage from them. As bareback performers
they have had few superiors.</p>

<p>Then I remember, too, many renowned animals
of my time. The Russian horse Zib, who was
poisoned in Mexico, achieved fame more for his
tricks than his ring exhibitions. Dan Rice&#8217;s horses
Excelsior and Excelsior, Jr., although both blind,
were wonderfully intelligent. Obeying their master&#8217;s
directions, they would grope to a pedestal, place
the left foot on its staff, bend the right leg gracefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and incline both ears forward as if in the act
of listening. How often have I, in an adjacent
ring, seen the veteran clown turn proudly to the
audience and heard him announce: &#8220;Mark well the
beauty of the curve of the right leg, which strikes
the eye of the sculptor. Horace Greeley calls
them the horses with souls of men!&#8221; Levi J.
North&#8217;s horse Cincinnatus was probably the first
&#8220;dancing&#8221; equine, and Stickney&#8217;s Tammany was
the best jumper that ever came to my knowledge.
Wicked Will, owned by Spalding and Rogers,
eclipsed most animals in difficult feats of various
kinds. Rarey&#8217;s horse Cruiser, although never a
circus performer, was invaluable to his owner in
horse &#8220;taming&#8221; exhibitions, and seemed to execute
his duties with human intelligence.</p>

<p>Thus I live again the days of old and unfold the
roll of my eventful history. My thoughts travel
fondly back to the scenes I am to behold no more,
and my heart throbs with emotions excited by
their reminiscences. I remember those gone to
their rest and shed a tear to their memory. For
myself, only ignominy and mental anguish. I,
who have been an honor to my birthplace and an
ornament to my race, wearily await the final summons.
In the array of names of illustrious circus
horses, may my memory be cherished faithfully is
the hope of miserable</p>

CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>THE CIRCUS BAND<br />

<small>BY BANDMASTER WILLIAM MERRICK</small></small></h2></div>


<p>Few people who watch the circus parade as it
comes down the street and who, almost invariably,
cry, &#8220;Strike up the band!&#8221; &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you
play!&#8221; &#8220;Let her go!&#8221; etc., have ever given a
thought to the amount of work that falls to the
circus musician, and the experience, care and patience
it requires to organize and successfully conduct
this nowadays necessary adjunct to the big
tent enterprises. The earlier circus bands were far
from being the complete affairs of to-day, and
perhaps nothing gives a more striking example of
the growth in civilization and culture of our country
than the evolution of the circus band.</p>

<p>The bands carried by the first circuses and menageries
were necessarily limited in size and not
always composed of the best talent. Travelling as
they did by wagon, and being forced by lack of
transportation facilities to curtail the number of
their people, and the accommodation of the performers
coming in for first consideration, the band
was looked upon in those days much in the light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
of a disagreeable necessity. Often the engaging of
the music was left to the last moment, and frequently
the earlier shows were content with picking
up a roving gypsy band, similar to the ones
we now see playing for pennies, under the windows
of the residential quarters of our large cities.</p>

<p>As might have been expected, the first really
military bands that were introduced into the circus
business were of European origin, but even
they were not so complete in numbers and so
especially adapted in character to the purpose as
the present circus military band. Still among
them were occasionally musicians of exceptional
ability, and many of the better soloists of our
metropolitan bands and orchestras were at one
period of their career members of a travelling circus
band. But it is not the intention of this
article to attempt a history of all the musical
notables connected with the circus, but rather to
contrast the circus band of to-day with that of
the past.</p>

<p>Let us take a glance at the repertoire of the old
time circus band. The overtures and grand entree
were played by brass instruments alone, the
usual instrumentation being three cornets (generally
two E and one B), two E horns, one B
tenor, baritone and bass, the drums being played
by such performers as could (to use a slang expression)
&#8220;fake&#8221; a little. Two to four overtures,
and perhaps one or two selections or pot-pourris,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
composed their entire libraries in this respect. The
incidental music for the various acts was almost
invariably played with string instruments, the
orchestra being composed of two violins (first and
second), flute or piccolo, clarionet, two cornets,
trombone, and bass.</p>

<p>I recall an amusing incident connected with the
piccolo player of one of these travelling orchestras.
The leader, a very good violinist by the way, had
occasion to correct the piccolo player, and asked
in a very pompous manner, &#8220;Bill, why don&#8217;t you
play that last strain an octave higher?&#8221; To
which Bill nonchalantly replied, &#8220;Professor, I am
now playing higher than my salary goes.&#8221; As the
company was not noted for its liberality in the
way of salaries, the retort was highly relished by
the balance of the orchestra.</p>

<p>The numbers that could be produced by a small
number of instruments were exceedingly few, so the
libraries of the travelling leaders were of a consequence
limited.</p>

<p>Now all this is changed. The extreme competition
between the music publishers of to-day and the
practicability of our experienced modern managers,
render it possible for a leader who is at all enterprising
to obtain not only all the standard and
classical overtures and selections, but an almost
endless programme of popular music for the
promenade concert that now precedes the performance
with every large or well regulated circus.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>But to be thoroughly efficient and &#8220;up-to-date,&#8221;
the latter-day circus leader must not rest content
with a pleasing or popular concert programme.
There is the performance or incidental music to be
looked after, and for this purpose the leader, to
suit the varying tastes of the performers and public,
must frequently draw on his own powers of
composition. Every act, or series of acts, requires
music exactly in keeping with its character. Nor
will it do to keep one programme on too long; the
performer grows tired of it, the musicians become
careless, and the music itself (so fast is the age in
which we live) becomes mildewed, and out of date.</p>

<p>By this it will be seen that the circus leader&#8217;s
life, if he keep abreast of the times, is a very busy
one, nor is the improvement confined solely to the
augmentation of the musical library. The band,
instead of being confined to the poorly balanced
and limited instrumentation that we have just
mentioned, is composed of sufficient reed to soften
the natural harshness of the brass instruments,
and the individual performers are selected from the
youngest and best talent our country affords. I
say &#8220;youngest,&#8221; for the rising generation having
had the advantage of the experience and teaching
of their predecessors in the &#8220;art divine,&#8221; possess
in a marked degree that mobility of temperament,
accuracy of attack, and facility of execution, so
necessary in rendering properly the circus music of
the present day. Then they must begin young in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the circus business to acquire the proper embouchure
for playing almost an unlimited amount
double forte, over rough streets, and still be able
to render pianissimo in the concert programme
following the parade.</p>

<p>No amount of practice in the conservatory or
concert room can obtain this embouchure. It
must be acquired by actual experience, on the
circus band wagon. A band composed of the better
class of musicians that have &#8220;come up&#8221; in the
circus business will render almost double the
volume of tone of the same number taken from
the theatre orchestra or concert stage, and if they
have been properly handled by a painstaking and
efficient leader, the quality will be also be found
superior.</p>

<p>The life of the circus musician, filled as it is with
plenty of hard work, is not without its sunny side.
The constant change of scene incident to travel
alone is a great factor in dispelling weariness.
The open air life renders it the most healthful of
occupations, while the antics of the rustic who
comes into town to see the parade and hear the
band, are an endless source of amusement. The
music for the parade, played as it is in a very
lively tempo, causes all manner of grotesque
movements among the listeners on the streets.
This is particularly noticeable on the southern
tours. It is no uncommon thing for a number of
&#8220;darkies&#8221; to start at the circus grounds and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
dance through the entire route of the parade; and
when in doubling back on the main street, which
is often necessary in the smaller towns, the band
passes the steam calliope, which brings up the
rear, the din caused by the mingling of the band-music
with the shrill whistle of this instrument,
seems to throw them into a veritable frenzy. During
one of these parades the following colloquy
was overheard between two of these over-excited

<p>I remember an astonishing but blessed effect the
music of our circus band had on a woman in
Grand Island, Nebraska, in 1882. She had been
blind for years and was sitting dejectedly at a
window as we approached in parade. When opposite
her, we burst suddenly into brazen harmony,
and the woman gave a scream of great joy. The
shock of the music had caused her to regain her
eyesight.</p>

CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>WITH THE ELEPHANTS</small></h2></div>


<p>&#8220;Jumbo was the biggest elephant ever in this
country, and few are in the secret that the tremendous
success of the animal&#8217;s tour was an accident
of fortune,&#8221; observed our elephant man.
&#8220;He was an African animal and very stupid, but
always good-natured. An agent of the big American
circus heard that he was the tallest pachyderm
in captivity and that London was anxious to sell
him. The man closed the sale for two thousand
pounds with no conception of the money-making
prize he was securing. The beast had been a pet
with the children in the London Zoological Gardens,
but the announcement of his purchase by
Americans was received with no especial expressions
of regret. It required two weeks to build a
van-like cage for the journey by sea, and then
keepers went to the zoo to lead Jumbo to the
ship. He strode along all right until the gate of
the garden closed behind them and then lay down
in the street. It was a pure case of elephantine
obstinacy and the animal wouldn&#8217;t budge. There
he measured his length in the dust for twenty-four
hours despite all urging and entreaty, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
despair of his custodians, who little realized the
wonderful effect the incident would have on the
owner&#8217;s pocketbook.</p>

<p>&#8220;The English newspapers soon heard of the
occurrence and promptly seized upon it for an
effective &#8216;story.&#8217; &#8216;Dear old Jumbo,&#8217; they said,
&#8216;refused to leave the scene of his happy days with
the children; his exhibition of protest was one of
remarkable sagacity; they hoped he would continue
to defy the Yankee showmen and remain in
London; he was the pet and friend of the little
ones and ought never to have been disposed of,
any way.&#8217; The elephant when in repose or resistance
rests on his knees, and one of the newspaper
sagely remarked that Jumbo was in an attitude
of prayer. The Humane Society was appealed to
and someone made a sympathetic hit by telling
how lonesome and melancholy was Alice, the
abandoned &#8216;wife.&#8217; The pathos of the thing was
very affecting, on the surface, but a phenomenal
advertisement.</p>

<p>&#8220;The animal finally got on his feet and marched
to the boat. Weeping women and children lined
the way. The circus owners were then alive to the
possibilities and, concealing their identity, got out
an injunction, &#8216;in the interests of the London
public,&#8217; attempting to restrain the brute&#8217;s departure.
Of course, it was dissolved, but it kept
feeling at high pitch up to the time of sailing. I
remember the Baroness Burdett-Coutts and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
party of distinguished companions visited the
steamer to say good-bye and left a big box of
buns, of which Jumbo was very fond, for his use
during the voyage.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_182f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">ELEPHANT HERD &#8220;AT ATTENTION.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The story of the brute&#8217;s reluctance to leave his
young friends in England was judiciously spread
broadcast here and he became the feature of the
circus, whereas otherwise he would probably have
attracted only passing attention. It was his own
fortuitous conduct and not the superior skill of
the showman that made his circus career so profitable.
Jumbo was killed by a train at St.
Thomas, Ontario, in July, 1885. A dwarf elephant
with him escaped injury, and the show
made some capital by asserting that the big elephant
sacrificed his own life in shielding his small
companion. As a matter of fact, he was seized
with another fit of unyielding stubbornness and
wouldn&#8217;t step down an embankment out of an
express&#8217;s path. He was never south of Louisville
or west of Omaha. Matthew Scott was his keeper.
He shared not only his bed, but his bread and
tobacco with his charge. After the brute&#8217;s death
he followed the circus wherever it went, and during
the winter visited almost daily the preserved skin
and bones of his late companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was, of course, a Jumbo II., but he was
nowhere near the size of the original beast. Harnessed
with electrodes and other apparatus he
stood in the middle of the Stadium at the Exposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Grounds at Buffalo, N. Y., on November 9,
1901, and gave the world a practical demonstration
that an elephant can take twenty-two hundred
volts of electricity with apparent unconcern.
If the electric current reached his nerves he manifested
no sign of it. Electric wires had been run
from the Exposition power house to what was to
be Jumbo II.&#8217;s death platform, and when the signal
was given, twenty-two hundred volts were
turned on. It merely tickled the beast. Jumbo II.
was unharnessed and taken back to his home in
the Midway. Explanations made by the electricians
were that the elephant&#8217;s hide had the resistance
of rubber and formed a non-conductor
impervious to electricity. Others said the voltage
was not sufficient. He had developed man-killing
qualities, but is still alive.</p>

<p>&#8220;When Jumbo was brought into this country,
Adam Forepaugh made great claims for his elephant
Bolivar. He insisted in large type and in
many newspapers and on the billboards of his
route that Bolivar was bigger than the elephant
from London. W. W. Cole, then conducting a show
of his own, claimed, too, that his animal, Samson,
was no smaller than Jumbo. Bolivar attracted
great attention through the country while with
Mr. Forepaugh. Finally he became so vicious that
he was given away to the city of Philadelphia,
where he could be more closely watched. I remember
the story of the narrow escape of two lumbermen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
in Michigan. They came to the show very
drunk and wanting to fight. They threatened Mr.
Forepaugh, who stood at the door, but he said he
wasn&#8217;t a fighting man and sent them on into the
menagerie tent. They were stalwart fellows, with
muscles hardened by rough out-door work, but I
doubt not the owner of the circus could have
bested either one in a pugilistic encounter. Mr.
Forepaugh was a man of tremendous strength and,
when aroused, a match for the most skilful slugger.
The boasting visitors had not been under
canvas five minutes before the sound of lamentations
penetrated to the door. Hurrying inside,
Mr. Forepaugh found one of the men, he who had
been particularly bold and aggressive and threatening,
crying like a baby. Tears dropped from his
eyes as he explained that he had sought out
Bolivar and challenged the huge beast to personal
combat. The elephant appeared to have relished
the joke keenly, for he had swung his powerful
trunk at the man and deftly plucked his soft felt
hat from its uncombed resting place. The beast&#8217;s
eyes had twinkled merrily, it was averred, as he
conveyed the headpiece to his capacious mouth
and swallowed it at a gulp. The terrorized victim,
his swagger changed to cringing fright, was
too overcome to even ask for the price of a new
hat as he fled toward home. Mr. Forepaugh
laughed gleefully. Bolivar&#8217;s digestive powers were
equal to the demands of the morsel.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>&#8220;Bolivar had a long and eventful history.
Probably his most thrilling experience was a terrific
fight with an untamed Nubian lion named
Prince at circus winter quarters in Philadelphia, in
December, 1885. The lion escaped from his cage,
chased a keeper out of the building and proceeded
to the elephant quarters. Bolivar stood nodding
where he was chained to a stake near the door.
Prince hesitated for a moment and then lay back
on his haunches. He crept slowly forward until he
was within reach of the elephant. Then he raised
his paw and struck at the supine trunk. The
tough skin was somewhat torn and Bolivar became
instantly fully awake, and raising his trunk
made a blow at the lion. The latter escaped by
jumping backward, then crouched again and prepared
to spring. Quick as a lightning flash was
the movement which landed him on the elephant&#8217;s
head. But he had to deal with a power greater
than his own, over which his only advantage was
his agility. Bolivar easily shook him off and
tossed him some distance. The contest was then
quickly decided. The lion prepared for another
spring. With ears flattened against his head and
eyes gleaming like balls of fire he crept forward
stealthily, cautiously measuring the distance.
With a suppressed growl the lithe, tawny form
shot through the air. The elephant&#8217;s trunk was
then turned over his back and his little black eyes
were snapping viciously. With a motion so quick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
as to be almost imperceptible, the proboscis was
lowered and elevated twice and then descended
with terrific force, striking the lion as he was in
mid-air. The beast of prey fell stunned, and before
he could recover the elephant dealt him a terrific
blow in the side, and reaching forward the full
length of his chain he drew his antagonist toward
him. Then lifting his free foot he leaned his entire
weight on the fallen foe. The effect was to crush
the ribs of the conquered monarch of the forest.
In this manner he trampled all over the lion until
life was gone. Then he raised it with his trunk,
and tossed it contemptuously to the other end of
the room. Bolivar sustained no serious injury in
the affray. There would have been general relief
among the employees if the lion had killed him, for
all were in fear of their lives near the monster.</p>

<p>&#8220;The white elephant campaign in the &#8217;80s was
about the fiercest bit of circus rivalry I was ever
mixed up in,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;The Barnum show
was the first to get one of the brutes. Their
agent bought him from King Theebaw, the erratic
sovereign of Burmah. The elephant was not
white, but a leprous-looking shade of flesh color.
It was really the first time one of these Albinos
had ever been brought out of Asia. All that the
king had done in the extravagant execution of
his autocratic power was as nothing compared to
the sale of the white elephant, and his subjects
were furious. You see, the white elephant is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
sacred emblem. It is addressed as the &#8216;Lord of
Lords.&#8217; Priests prostrate themselves as it passes
by and all the honors of worship are paid to it.
A noble of high rank has to be its chamberlain.
Its retinue is fit for a prince of the blood royal.
Sickness in the sacred animal is ominous of coming
evil. Its demeanor and gestures afford auguries,
auspicious or sinister. For three years the
Barnum white elephant made a lot of money for
the show. Crowds flocked to see it, serene and
placid and gently fanning itself with its wide ears,
under a large Japanese parasol, native keepers
meanwhile playing their queer musical instruments.
It was burned to death in 1887.</p>

<p>&#8220;The history of the Forepaugh white elephant
is more picturesque and eventful than that of the
rival circus. The boss was taken all by surprise
when the other show sprang the natural curiosity,
but he was quick to act. Before the Barnum animal
had reached this country from London, a
dispatch in the newspapers from Algiers announced
the purchase there by Forepaugh of a
white elephant for ten thousand pounds. Its entry
into America must needs have been accomplished
with great secrecy and haste, for the beast was
on exhibition in less than a month after the
story of the sale. Then the competition for white
elephant supremacy began, and it continued bitterly
during the existence of the two animals.
We made all sorts of charges of deceit and trickery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
against the Barnum elephant, and that show
advertised us all over the land as cheats and impostors
and swindlers. Our elephant was almost
pure white. He had a car all to himself and on
the way to and from the lot was swathed in cotton
cloth. Only his eyes were visible and public
curiosity was heightened considerably when was
observed the pains we exerted to prevent a free
view of the curiosity&#8217;s hide. In the menagerie
tent we had a performance of religious rites before
the animal by reputed Burmese priests, clad in
shimmering robes of yellow, red and white silk.
Some observing visitor once remarked unkindly
that the religious act terminated suddenly when
the menagerie tent was empty and was resumed
with wonderful alacrity when spectators approached.
It is true that the elephant was a
more snowy white on Monday than at any other
time of the week, although sometimes the skin
had been spotted and stained on Saturday. To
prove that it was no artificial color, Forepaugh
used sometimes to send the brute into the water.
He was rubbed and scoured without affecting his
shade. The boss was sure that there could be no
charge of disguise or pretence after that, although
suspicious onlookers sometimes said something
about waterproof paint. Any way, we got an international
authority on zoology in Philadelphia
to endorse the white elephant. His sponsorship
made the Barnum people furious and their circus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
followed us west, denouncing us everywhere. We
made them madder still by buying a white monkey
and making it the elephant&#8217;s companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;In Chicago we came across an embassy from
Siam which was touring this country. Forepaugh
had the audacity to invite the heir-apparent to
the Siamese throne, who was one of the party, to
visit the show and inspect the white elephant.
The royal person came, accompanied by other
dignitaries, looked the beast over and muttered
to the interpreter something which was apparently
not complimentary. The press agent saw to it,
however, that the newspapers said that the
prince had declared the animal the genuine article.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our white elephant died from pneumonia, the
newspapers told, at the winter quarters in Philadelphia.
There were no details of the burial.
White elephants are delicate in constitution, any
way. Certain persons who thought themselves
wise said that the &#8216;dying&#8217; experience was a cessation
of &#8216;dyeing,&#8217; but they were inspired by the
Barnum show. The following season a dark,
natural beast, in form much resembling the white
elephant appeared as &#8216;John L. Sullivan,&#8217; the
boxing elephant. He wore a glove on the end of
his trunk and swung gently at &#8216;Eph&#8217; Thompson,
a colored trainer. His career as a pugilist continued
for five years, when he became so big and
strong that no human being could withstand his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
blows. He is now one of the Forepaugh herd
which perform a famous dancing act.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a matter of fact, I know that R. F. Hamilton,
the accomplished director of the Barnum &amp;
Bailey press department, has in his possession
affidavits from the Forepaugh employees whose
duty it was to see that the white elephant never
faded, in which they confess their perfidy. A brush
and snowy liquid were the only requirements.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our circus carries a herd of twenty-five elephants
and most of them are trained in all sorts of difficult
elephant performances, a task requiring patience
and perseverance, and a close and continuous
study of the nature of each individual animal.
Of all beasts, the elephant is probably the most
sagacious. He never forgets. Trainers aver that
after a lapse of half a century the elephant will
conduct his performance as perfectly as if but
twenty-four hours had gone by. Their value to a
circus rests not merely upon the attraction of
their ring exhibition. Their great strength makes
them useful when heavy wagons defy the straining
efforts of horses, and they are frequently called
into other service which requires unusual power.
The application of the broad head gives motion
to the most obstinately stationary vehicle, and
often extricates the show from annoying plight
and delay.</p>

<p>There are two distinct species of elephants. The
Asiatic differs from the African, not only in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
greater size and in the characteristics of the teeth
and skull, but also in the comparative small form
of the ears, the pale-brown color of skin and in
having four nails on the hind feet instead of three.
The intelligence of the former class is greater, too,
than that of the African brute, whose head is
much shorter, the forehead convex and the ears of
great breadth and magnitude, covering nearly a
sixth of the entire body.</p>

<p>The average term of an elephant&#8217;s life is probably
about eighty years, and he is not in possession
of full vigor and strength until more than
thirty years old. An approximate idea of the age
can be gained by the amount of turn-over of the
upper edge of the ear. The edge is quite straight
until the animal is eight or nine years old; then it
begins to turn over. By the time the beast is
thirty the edges lap over to the extent of an inch;
and between this age and sixty the droop increases
to two inches or more. Extravagant
ideas are held as to the height of an elephant.
Such a thing as an elephant measuring twelve
feet at the shoulder does not exist in India or
Burmah. An authority on the subject says the
largest male he ever met with measured nine feet ten
inches, and the tallest female eight feet five inches.
The majority of elephants, however, are below
eight feet, and an animal rarely reaches nine feet,
the female being slightly shorter than the male.
The carcass of an elephant seven feet four inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
tall, weighed in portions, gave a total weight
of thirty-nine hundred pounds; so an elephant
weighing two tons should be common enough.
The skin was about three-quarters of an inch to
one inch thick.</p>

<p>The training of elephants for exhibition purposes
is accomplished by a block and tackle and harness,
so arranged as to force them into required
positions. They learn easily, as compared with
the cat family of animals. It is only by the most
constant surveillance by the keepers, however,
that the elephant is kept in good humor and not
tempted to display the ferocity which is one of his
natural attributes.</p>

<p>The first elephant ever born in captivity in this
country saw the light at the winter quarters of Mr.
Bailey&#8217;s Show, at the corner of Ridge avenue and
Twenty-third street, Philadelphia, on March 10,
1880, at twenty-five minutes to three o&#8217;clock in the
morning. The event attracted a great deal of attention
among scientists and students of natural history.
From the time the circus went into winter
quarters, several of the most distinguished physicians
of the city regularly visited the prospective
mother, and the diet and conduct of the animal
were studied with great care. Crowds of people
flocked to see the baby. Its birth disproved a great
many theories which scientific men had accepted as
facts of zoology since the days of Pliny. The chief
of these were that the period of gestation is twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
months and twenty days, and not from twenty-two
to twenty-three months as had been supposed,
and that the young does not suckle the mother
through the trunk but through the mouth. The
baby, whose mother, Hebe, was oftener called
&#8220;Baby,&#8221; weighed one hundred and twenty-six
pounds, was thirty inches high and measured
thirty-five inches from the tip of the trunk to the
crupper. It was of a pale mauve color. The
trainer of Hebe explained to the scientists that the
other animals in the herd were aware of Hebe&#8217;s
condition for months and exhibited their form of
elephantine courtesy to her. Upon one occasion,
he asserted, Hebe was about to fall from a broken
pedestal in the ring when the other elephants
rushed to the rescue. With their huge bodies they
formed a cushion against which she fell, sliding
gently to the ground. Whenever Hebe called, the
other elephants invariably rushed to her side, and
the man who tried to abuse her would have met
instant death. So great was the interest aroused
in the baby elephant&#8217;s birth that Stuart Craven,
manager of the circus, received telegrams from all
parts of the United States suggesting names for
her. One man offered to buy a robe for her if
given a name he suggested. A lady wanted the
baby called after her. The name Columbia was
finally selected. After the birth of her infant, Hebe
tossed the little one around like a shuttlecock,
and in her frenzy twisted off a large beam with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
her trunk. It was found necessary to secure her
with chains.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_194f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">ELEPHANTS &#8220;WORKING THEIR WAY.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next baby elephant came to life at the winter
quarters of Barnum&#8217;s circus at Bridgeport,
Conn., at eight o&#8217;clock on the night of February
2, 1882. It was another female, and the mother
was Queen, a fifteen-year-old animal. The event
was expected, and at six o&#8217;clock in the evening
indications of its coming were noticed. Queen was
carefully chained. After fifteen minutes of laboring
the baby was born. Mr. Barnum and others who
were summoned did not arrive in time. The baby
weighed forty-five pounds, or eighty-one less than
Columbia. It was two feet six inches high and
three feet long, exclusive of the trunk which was
seven inches. It was perfect in form and quite
strong. Its color was bluish, and it was covered
with shaggy black hair an inch long. An hour
after its birth it was sucking. Mr. Barnum offered
fifty-two thousand dollars for an insurance on the
life of the baby for fifty-two weeks. He was jubilant
and said three hundred thousand dollars
would be no temptation to sell her. The sire of
the baby was Chief.</p>

<p>A woman mastering the leviathans of the animal
kingdom was one of the wonders of a circus in
1887. She was Mrs. William Newman, wife of
&#8220;Elephant Bill,&#8221; who had grown up with the circus.
She was a matronly looking person, quite
stout and pleasant-mannered, devoid withal of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
masculine traits that her occupation might seem
to require. At her command the elephants, eight
in number, marched, wheeled, countermarched,
halted promptly and &#8220;grounded arms&#8221; by lying
on their sides. Then, like schoolboys, delighted at
a release from what they deemed duty, the huge
beasts broke ranks and assumed different postures
and occupations about the ring. One of
them stood on his head, another turned a grind-stone
with his trunk, a third walked on a revolving
barrel, and several others respectively engaged,
to their own apparent amusement, in dancing on
a pedestal, ringing a bell and &#8220;clapping hands.&#8221;
Mrs. Newman gave few public exhibitions, and
there has never since been a successful woman elephant
trainer. For some reason, they fail in this
branch of circus work, whereas in other departments
they are fully the equals of the other sex.</p>

CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>THE GENERAL MANAGER</small></h2></div>


<p>The brisk and bustling person who predominates
in the stir and activity, hurry and excitement at
the main entrance, is the general manager. Nothing
seems to escape his watchful eve and alert
ear.</p>

<p>He answers questions innumerable and all-embracing,
settles all disputes as to admission, conveys
advice, makes suggestions, gives orders,
sends lieutenants all over the lot with instructions,
sees to it that the crowd gets in safely
but without delay, watches ticket-seller and ticket-taker,
and is in general active charge of the
&#8220;door.&#8221;</p>

<p>His is a very important department of circus
life, requiring peculiar natural talents, wide
experience, correct knowledge of law and logic,
familiarity with affairs, and ability to manipulate
men and mayors. The grave responsibilities of
the circus are his and they are enough to weaken
brain and body.</p>

<p>He is one of the first men off the cars in the
morning and his day frequently ends when all his
comrades are sleeping with the peace and vigor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
perfect health and a clear conscience afford. There
is no working hour when some one of his multifarious
duties does not claim his attention. He is
first of all a license and contract specialist. There
is nothing about their force or character or price
in any part of the country he has not at his
finger ends. The pecuniary cost to the show of
the privileges it enjoys is entirely in his keeping.
His morning is devoted to municipal and county
officers and office holders. His long service has
made him personally acquainted with many of
them in all parts of the country. He belongs to
nearly all secret societies and social organizations,
which helps his purposes; he distributes admission
tickets with lavish freedom where they will &#8220;do
good;&#8221; his instinct tells him how long to entertain
and not bore, and his errand over, a favorable
impression remains. The result has been the
promise of gratuitous official favors and almost
invariably a reduced rate for permits.</p>

<p>The policing of the grounds and the protection
of the show and of its patrons are in the general
manager&#8217;s charge. In this the circus detective is
his ally and adviser, but the burden of results is
his. He assures the chief of police of the honest
motives of the organization, tells him no thieves
or criminals are tolerated, promises that there
shall be no disorder or violence on the part of the
circus people, and asks in return protection and
cooperation. How inadequately the police of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
many towns can meet the needs of the occasion is
told in another chapter of this book.</p>

<p>The circus is subject to a system of plunder,
blackmail and robbery en route that is unheard
of in any other business. All classes of people
seem ready to render a hand in the nefarious
game, considering the circus fair prey. It requires
the most diplomatic management to extricate the
show without financial loss or legal proceedings,
and frequently, after all, it must submit to extortion
to escape attachments. These are usually
levied upon the ticket wagon just before the evening
performance or upon a pole wagon as the
tents are being pulled down. This sort of legal
robbery occurs in many towns. The show may
think it is getting off all right when suddenly
some accident, some chance injury to property or
persons, affords an excuse for a levy.</p>

<p>An amusing incident among the varied pretexts
for &#8220;hold up&#8221; was that we encountered in Biddeford,
Maine. The day had progressed without
untoward incident and at nine o&#8217;clock we thought
the chance of legal trouble was past. Then, suddenly,
appeared an irate resident, whose home
adjoined the lot, with the declaration that our
monkey cage cat was his wife&#8217;s, and with a demand
that we return her forthwith. He may have been
laboring under a truly mistaken impression, but
his subsequent conduct made us believe not, for
upon our decided refusal, he made an attachment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
The general manager decided then to grant the
visitor&#8217;s claim; the feline wasn&#8217;t worth legal
bother and expenditure. The proceeding cost
the circus nine dollars in fees and left the monkeys
in mourning. It had been their playful
practice to convey struggling tabby to the top
of the cage and then hurl her violently to the
floor.</p>

<p>I recall the case of a Westerner who insisted that
one of our elephants had eaten his pig. Neighbors
swarmed to the scene, ready with a tale of having
seen the huge beast&#8217;s trunk encircle the squealing
victim and thrust him into a capacious mouth.
The owner wanted twenty-five dollars. A canvasman,
sent to investigate, found the porker under
an adjacent house.</p>

<p>It is the solution of these and far more serious
similar problems, that are a highly important
branch of the general manager&#8217;s work, and upon
his management and disposition of them depends
much money and annoyance. If the grievance is
just and fair, he is ready to make ample financial
reimbursement. He expects and receives imposition,
but if not carried too far, he settles for cash
and gets a full legal release. If the demand made
is outrageous in amount, and the claimant stubborn
and menacing and uncompromising, then, to
his astonished dismay, he is told to carry out his
threats as he sees fit. Of course, the delay of a
trial or even a hearing would cost the circus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
thousands of dollars, but the general manager has
provided against this contingency. In every town
the circus exhibits, there, too, is the representative
of the American Surety Company, prepared
with surety for any amount. The levy is made, accepted
with unconcern, financial pledge is given, and
the show moves to the train and away. It is all
very perplexing and painful to the man with the exaggerated
sense of affliction, and he wishes he had
been more moderate in speech and demand and
not so hasty in action. If an amicable settlement
be not made out of court, he finds that the circus
will fight him to the bitter legal end.</p>

<p>The general manager appears like magic when
there is an accident or injury in which the circus
is involved. These are of almost daily occurrence.
The lion or tiger may gleefully claw the too far
outstretched hand of the curious boy; a horse
perhaps kicks or bites; there are runaways and
runovers, and a variety of other mishaps extending
from cars to lot and from arrival to departure.
The general manager always strives to be at the
scene ahead of the artful lawyer, who would fain
share in the damages. He is apologetic and regretful,
offers cash remuneration and receives
a written statement of satisfaction. Not until
then does he breathe freely; but rest assured that
in the transaction he has given no outward indication
of his troubled mind and that in the bargain
he has made the circus has not come out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
second best. The show people who watch him
daily grow to look on him as ubiquitous.</p>

<p>Many and marvellous are the tales told him
with the design of securing free admission. The
street commissioner is a permanent applicant.
The general manager knows the story by heart.
The heavy pole wagons have damaged the highways;
a few tickets will wipe out the injury. He
generally gets in. The man whose land has been
encroached upon by the tents; the policeman with
the small army of eager children; the householder
who avers the elephant&#8217;s prehensile trunk mutilated
an inviting tree; the alderman&#8217;s brother;
the clergyman who declares he has always heretofore
been a welcome guest, and the long list of
others with claim to recognition, get a hearing
with varying success. The policeman is the most
persistent. The circus is in a measure at his
mercy and he is insatiable. He becomes a numerous
husband and his relatives are legion. It is for
the general manager to get quarter and he must
go about it without offending; for there may
be need for blue-coated service before the day
is done, and the show must not lose official
favor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Plain-clothes&#8221; men, the policemen assigned to
duty at circus in ordinary street attire, are usually
a nuisance. In the smaller towns they have
little or no conception of their duties&mdash;to watch
out for crooks without exciting suspicion&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
they hover about the entrance, proud to be on
familiar and confidential terms with the management,
&#8220;passing-in&#8221; acquaintances, bothering with
questions and generally obstructing the smooth
progress of things. Their detective instinct and
experience are nil, and their questionable value to
the circus is confined to knowing the town drunkard
and the tough of local notoriety, whose
demeanor is sober and demure enough when opposed
to the ready rank and file of the show.</p>

<p>Numerous special officers and sheriff&#8217;s deputies
have been sworn in for the occasion. These throw
wide their coats, displaying to the ticket-taker
their badges of office fastened to suspender or
waistcoat, and are permitted to enter the tents.
Their presence is needed, the general manager has
been gravely assured, to aid in the police arrangements
in the contingency of riot or panic. The
circus knows, of course, that they are the friends
and relatives of the official heads of the town,
who manage, with the immunity from payment the
badge conveys, to see the show free. In case of
trouble or a call for their services not one of them
would respond.</p>

<p>When the general manager is in a facetious
mood and has an idle moment, we have a stock
joke ready for the &#8220;plain clothes&#8221; arrayed at the
door. I bustle up to the ropes, throw open my
coat as if revealing a hidden badge of office; the
doortender, who enjoys the diversion immensely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
nods assent and I pass in. Then the stolid wits
of the detectives operate and they move in a body
to the serious-visaged manager and whisper that
he has been imposed upon, that I am a stranger
and not a special officer as I represented, and
therefore not entitled to admission. My friend
waxes very indignant, I, agitated and crestfallen,
am led back to the entrance, lectured sternly and
threatened with arrest as an impostor, and
ejected. The detective force, glutted with pride
over the masterly accomplishment, receives profuse
thanks. Later the manager and I have a hearty
laugh together.</p>

<p>The canvasmen and teamsters, hearty, brawny
fellows, and peaceable unless inflamed with liquor,
all respect and esteem the manager and appreciate
that, while he is unrelentingly severe when there is
an infraction of rules, his discipline is always fair
and impartial. He plays no favorites. For profanity
and vulgarity he will accept no mitigating
excuse. In Johnstown, Pa., we were walking to
the lot one beautiful Sunday morning when the
loud oaths of a driver attracted our attention.
He was directing his foul expressions at a child,
who in its curiosity to see the gorgeous wagon,
had narrowly escaped being run over. Residents,
sitting at windows or on piazzas, were shocked at
the vile outpouring. They had never before appreciated
the resources of the language.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come down off the seat!&#8221; sternly commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the manager, his face grim and hard with anger.
&#8220;Now, go get your pay. You are discharged.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he mounted the red and gilded heights of
the vehicle, clucked to the eight horses and drove
like a veteran to the show grounds. The staff
detective was instructed to see to it that the culprit
was not permitted on the lot.</p>

<p>We showed two days in Pittsburg and there was
afforded an opportunity to witness the wealth of
resource, the courage, the tactful skill and the untiring
energy of the man. All went smoothly and
serenely the first day. Then came Saturday, when
the workmen of the circus received their weekly
pay. Across the street from the tents was a combined
saloon and hotel, which at once became the
focus of dissipation. A wave of inebriety seemed
to sweep in upon teamsters and canvasmen. One
by one they became extremely drunk and reduced
new-found friends to the same condition. By
night all order and decency had been abandoned
and they stood about the bar or lot shouting
and swearing, and making threats with knives or
clubs. The season was just beginning and time
had been too short for a discovery and weeding
out of the tough characters among the help. The
owner was making a hurried visit to his home,
three hundred miles distant, and the general
manager met the critical situation alone. How he
managed to conduct the performance, to break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
camp with the few employees who remained
staunch and true, and to load the trains and
move out of the city, none of our feeble brains
could ever grasp. But he accomplished it without
serious delay, without an affray of consequence,
and with a finish and skill which veiled from the
public the fact that anything out of the usual was
happening. Before the start from the railroad
yard there was a careful and systematic count of
men, stock, wagons, baggage and apparatus, for
some of the drivers, continuing the debauch, had deserted
their horses and vehicles in front of saloons.
All were finally rounded up. The transgression cost
seventy-five men their positions, and for the rest
of the season other circuses marvelled at our state
of grace and piety.</p>

<p>The general manager is rich in worldly possessions
and free with cash and credit. When one&#8217;s
supply of money runs short, from &#8220;butcher&#8221; to
man of high rank, he turns for temporary relief
to his more fortunate and more provident comrade.
His wants are always supplied, except in
isolated instances, for not to pay a just debt entails
the blight of universal condemnation and loss
of confidence and honor. It is in winter, when the
general manager is hiding from mankind in a
Florida shelter, that the demands come fast and
urgent and never pass unheeded. For then it is
that the thriftless circus man, who knows no
business except that which warm weather provides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
is in a pecuniary predicament. The manager&#8217;s
bounty extends to his friends in all parts
of the country, but a few weeks of the next season
sees it returned to him with grateful appreciation.</p>

<p class="caption">TRANSFERRING FROM WATER TO RAIL.</p>

<p>The conquest of the Old World by the Barnum
&amp; Bailey circus will live forever in the stirring history
of tented organizations. It made the enterprise
an object of international interest. There is
now practically no country in the world that does
not know the Barnum &amp; Bailey Show and recognize
that it and its ally, the Forepaugh &amp; Sells
Brothers Show, enjoy a happy, undisputed
monopoly.</p>

<p>As America reaches out for commercial predominance,
so the American circus challenged competition
abroad, and foreign rivals quivered and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
shrunk. England found and felt herself laboriously
behind hand, and other nations yielded pre-eminence.
For five years crowned heads showed
gracious appreciation and vied with one another
to express generous sentiments of welcome and
appreciation to the American envoy, and that
period records uniform success and not a single
failure. This profound impression made in other
lands is one of the proudest achievements of
American sagacity, resolution and ambition, and
directly stimulating to the pride of all Americans,
whose great good fortune it is now that the
Barnum &amp; Bailey circus has returned to contribute
to the happiness of humanity here.</p>

<p>Few, probably, appreciate the tremendous undertaking
involved in this picturesque invasion,
and the difficulties met and overcome. All
methods had to be adjusted to new surroundings
and new demands. The manner and matter of
work bore no resemblance to those here. The
extent and nature of changes affected all departments
of the organization. Every inch of the
territory travelled was unfamiliar. Languages and
people were strange. Yet the campaign was instituted
without prolonged preparation and with
no twinges of misgivings, so accustomed was this
great circus to demonstrating possibilities and so
perfect was it in planning and directing. It can
truly be said that it caters for the world.</p>

<p>A volume in itself would be required to tell the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
story of how the Barnum &amp; Bailey circus, in the
stern test of competition, forced all others into
insignificance during its travels abroad. Incidents
grave and gay, of life, action and adventure,
crowd the history of those five years. The
then Prince of Wales, now King Edward VII., I
recall, after witnessing several performances, sent
the personal message: &#8220;The circus is justly deserving
of the title &#8216;The Greatest Show on Earth&#8217;,
for it not only is certainly the greatest amusement
enterprise ever organized, but also the most
wonderful example of organization and discipline
one can hope to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even more signal an honor was that conferred
by Emperor Francis Joseph I., during the visit of
the circus to Vienna. Following an afternoon
under tents, his delighted imperial majesty sent to
Mr. James A. Bailey, managing director, accompanying
a letter of thanks for his entertainment,
a gold cigar case, relieved on one side by the
royal crown and the initials &#8220;F. J. I.&#8221; Twenty-five
scattered brilliants enhanced the intrinsic
value of the gift. Later the royal household requested
a complete set of circus lithographs for
the Emperor&#8217;s library.</p>

<p>The transportation of the show from London to
Hamburg is noteworthy from the fact that it was
the first time railway cars sixty feet long had
ever been loaded on board ship without being
taken apart. And they were taken from the vessel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and deposited on the tracks in Germany just
as they were removed from the tracks in London,
wheels and all, and were the first English-made
cars ever operated in the Kaiser&#8217;s domain. The
Barnum &amp; Bailey circus was the first tented institution
allowed to spread a canvas in Berlin.
After a rigid examination of the show in every
detail, the officials signed permits with the frank
expression that they had no apprehensions of
disaster in any form. The city is the headquarters
of the German army, and the discipline, precision
and business common-sense of the circus
civilians so impressed the principal officers that
they were in constant attendance. On the evening
of departure members of the General Staff witnessed
the breaking of the encampment, taking
copious notes, while another body put in the
night at the scene of embarkation at the railroad
yards.</p>

<p>Tributes like these to the enterprise and energy
and superior skill of the American circus men
covered the almost continuous period of their
foreign wanderings. Of difficulties overcome,
there was one whose extraordinary character I
feel certain would have caused any other than
Mr. James A. Bailey, the director of the Barnum
&amp; Bailey circus, to have abandoned the project
entirely. A few days before the opening of the
show in the Olympia in London, the County
Council decided that more precautionary fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
measures were necessary, and ordered the erection
of a giant curtain of iron and asbestos, to cover
one entire side of the vast amphitheatre. The required
outlay was $90,000, but Mr. Bailey, not a
bit dismayed, went at the task with characteristic
vigor and without delay, and accomplished it with
a celerity which filled the English mind with
astonished wonder. Moreover, when it came to
hanging the tremendous area and the workmen in
the employ of the firm to whom the contract had
been given feared to go aloft, he called his own
picked body of employees to the scene and they
did the job without friction or flinching.</p>

<p>I can truly say that no one is more honored in
circus history than Mr. Bailey, the presiding head
of this remarkable institution. It would be a
grateful duty to the world to rescue from self-imposed
oblivion the events connected with his
life, but the unusual modesty of the man forbids.
While others boast and glorify themselves, the
admitted &#8220;king of circus men&#8221; chooses personal
obscurity. All publicity attaching to his movements
is strangely distasteful; he wants the world
to know and approve only the enterprise to which
his life has been devoted and which his sagacious
efforts have solely borne to supremacy. No imagination
save his was once bold and radical
enough to grasp the future, and no other prophet
could foretell the rapid and enormous development
of the American circus.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>Only his old-time intimate associates know how
visionary were once accounted the broad methods
which have won him success, and the rebuffs and
hindrances of no common sort which were his
experiences. Through them all he worked ceaselessly,
patiently, resolutely, with the courage and
confidence of personal conviction, resigning personal
convenience, ease, social enjoyment and
other valued privileges, and the result has marked
him as the one dazzling genius of the profession.
To his employees he is like a father who sympathizes
with his children in their varied circumstances
of joy and sorrow. His benevolences are
large-hearted but judicious, and his integrity of the
rugged, old-fashioned type. He has shed a lustre
upon the profession which has won universal
recognition and admiration, and little wonder
that his return to his native land, his rightful
circus heritage, has been hailed with a burst of
cordial welcome and enthusiasm.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">
CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>THE OLD-FASHIONED CIRCUS</small></h2></div>


<p>&#8220;The size of the tent was rather staggering at
first, as the greatest length of the oval is nearly
two hundred feet, and standing at one end it is
impossible to distinguish with the naked eye the
features of those on the crowded seats at the
other end.&#8221;</p>

<p>I quote the foregoing paragraph, taken from a
newspaper of 1877, as illustrating by comparison
the physical magnitude of the circus of to-day.
Our &#8220;big tent&#8221; could stow away in its capacious
depths half a dozen of the canvas arenas of twenty-five
years ago, and our &#8220;menagerie top&#8221; covers
more area. The scanty side-show cloth, an insignificant
detail of the encampment, is not much
smaller.</p>

<p>Is the modern circus, with its bewildering array
of man and beast marvels, an improvement from
the public standpoint over the old-fashioned show
wherein the clown predominated and one ring
sufficed? Has there come with the expansion more
skill and hazard of performance? Do patrons
relish the relegation to oblivion of some time-honored
circus accomplishments, and the interpolation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of vaudeville? The circus performer of
former days will invariably answer these interrogations
in the negative; the circus owner and
manager makes no hesitation in disagreeing on
all points, and his conviction is that backed by
the weight of ticket wagon receipts. Whatever the
artistic merits and the drifting away from things
traditionary, certainly the opportunities for profit
have multiplied with the years. Everything favorable,
there is no more wonderful a money-maker
than the modern circus. Despite frequently expressed
longing, it is not likely that the public
would receive with favor the return of the old-fashioned
circus, no matter how alluring the performance
in its meagerness. The case of the small
circus of to-day bears this out. It is ignored if a
&#8220;big show&#8221; is headed its way.</p>

<p>After retrospective talks with many old performers
I cannot discover that the modern generation
of athletes has kept pace with the progress of
the business department of the circus. There are
few legitimate circus feats executed nowadays, so
far as I have been able to learn, which were not
equalled in years gone by, and there are instances
where supremacy is yielded to the men now retired;
many of their accomplishments have not
been duplicated. I cite the case of George Bachelor,
who was accustomed to single somersault over
ten elephants, and of &#8220;Bob&#8221; Stickney, who without
apparent exertion turned two somersaults in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
flight over twenty-three horses. Oscar Lowanda
has been the only person to improve materially
upon former equestrian acts. He succeeds in doing
a back somersault from the haunch of one
moving horse to that of another. In aerial performances
few new individual feats are in evidence.
The strides forward seem solely in the employment
of more persons in a single act. The Potters perform
ten in number, an unheard-of achievement
a few years ago. The strain of planning and
successfully carrying out the act, however, is
so intense that the head of the troupe had decided
to partially disband it when I talked with
him.</p>

<p>The life of the circus man of to-day is a continual
round of ease and luxury as compared
with the strenuous, haphazard existence of his
brother of a few decades ago. The memory of
this generation can shed no light on the origin of
the circus in this country, and there is no literature
definitely disclosing when the first travelling
organization reared its canvas. Seth B. Howe
was the first circus owner of note. &#8220;Bob&#8221; Stickney,
still a vigorous reminder of former days, remembers
the stories told of that time by his
father, Samuel Peck Stickney, who was a member
of the company. The advance agent made his
lonely journey on horseback. His saddle-bags
bulged with circus &#8220;paper,&#8221; which he tacked
wherever his judgment suggested, for it comprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
a welcome addition to the community&#8217;s supply
of reading matter. He was a smooth-tongued,
polished man of the times and full of wonderful
tales of the approaching circus. Curiosity and
excitement were at high pitch when the caravan
put in its appearance a fortnight later. The line
halted on the outskirts of the town, uniforms
were donned and a parade made to the scene of
exhibition. This was frequently in the spacious
yard of the local tavern. The centre pole of the
tent was cut daily in the abounding woods,
trimmed and dragged into place. The tavern provided
chairs and the church was drawn upon for
benches. An extra charge was imposed for the
use of these resting places. Admission to the circus
carried with it only the privilege of viewing
the performance standing. At night, candles furnished
illumination.</p>

<p>Trained horses and ponies composed much of the
show. The feats of the equestrian were amazing
in their daring, to the onlookers of that period.
The ringmaster made a preliminary announcement.
The rider, he proclaimed, would stand
erect on a horse in full motion<i>!</i> This accomplished,
amid wild enthusiasm, the hero of the
hour balanced himself on one foot and concluded
by playing a violin as the horse cantered around
the ring. This was before the broad saddle pad
had gone out of circus use. The rider who first
jumped over banners was given a fabulous salary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
and he who dared plunge through the familiar
paper balloon became rich in a year.</p>

<p>The night overland journeys of these old-time
circuses were full of dire peril. Highways were
dark and dreary and places of pitfalls. Each circus
wagon bore a flickering candle torch, showing
the route to the driver behind. Soon menageries
were added, and then an elephant. Hannibal, the
&#8220;war elephant,&#8221; was one of the first. There were
few nights when his services were not required to
extricate a wagon from mud or gully, or to urge
it up some steep incline. The old Van Amburg
circus transported a giraffe, a mournful beast
which few modern circuses are possessed of. Wood
choppers went ahead to clear the road with their
axes and permit the passage of the high cage.
Then came, in order of time, the side-show, with
the free exhibition in front&mdash;wire-walking, a balloon
ascension, a high-diving performance, or
feats on the &#8220;flying&#8221; trapeze.</p>

<p>Probably the most noted knight of the sawdust
ring was Dan Rice, who died in Long Branch,
N. J., on February 22, 1900, at the age of seventy-seven
years. His history was practically that
of the circus&mdash;the real old-fashioned circus&mdash;in
America. Daniel McLaren, his father, nicknamed
him Dan Rice, after a famous clown he had known
in Ireland, and the name clung to him. He
touched the heights and depths of circus luck,
making in his life three independent fortunes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
losing one after another. He died comparatively
poor. As acrobat and later clown, he travelled
every portion of the United States and extensively
in Europe. He first appeared as a clown in Galena,
Ill., the home of U. S. Grant, in 1844, and
from that time his popularity as a circus clown
increased amazingly. He retired in 1882, a hale
old man of sturdy frame and resonant voice,
whose hearty handshake it was a pleasure to feel.</p>

<p>Bobby Williams, Sam Lathrop, Sam Long, Joe
Pentland, Billy Kennedy, Jimmy Reynolds, William
Wallett, Frank Brown, Nat Austin, Herbert
Williams, Dan Gardiner, Bill Worrell and Tony
Pastor were other noted clowns and &#8220;Shakespearian
jesters&#8221; of his day, and most of them are
hale and hearty to this day. A press agent of
their time, not behind his lavish-languaged modern
brother, called attention to this group as &#8220;jolly,
jovial representatives of Momus, whose fund of wit
and humor has given them the proud titles of
America&#8217;s greatest wits and punsters; scholarly,
refined and every one fit to grace the proudest
court as its greatest jester. Merrier men within
the limits becoming mirth live not upon man&#8217;s
footstool&mdash;this greatest earth.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_224f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">HUMILIATION OF THE KING OF BEASTS.</p>

<p>In the old days of the clown, when one ring
furnished satisfying enjoyment, his was a very
important and conspicuous part of the performance.
His efforts of entertainment occupied the
sole attention of the audience at times, as with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
voice or action he provided fun and folly. It was
as a songster that he was at his best. Perched
on a stool in the centre of the ring&mdash;thrown up of
soil and not the portable wooden, forty-two foot
diametered affair of to-day&mdash;his vocal enlivenments
were a source of much laughter and merriment.
Here is a type of the old-time clown song, which
none who ever witnessed one of the shows will
fail to recall:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I don&#8217;t mind telling you,</div>
<div class="indent">I took my girl to Kew,</div>
<div class="verse">And Emma was the darling creature&#8217;s name.</div>
<div class="indent">While standing on the pier,</div>
<div class="verse">Some folks did at her leer,</div>
<div class="indent">And one and all around her did exclaim:</div>
<div class="indent3">Whoa, Emma! Whoa, Emma!</div>
<div class="indent2">Emma, you put me in quite a dilemma.</div>
<div class="indent3">Oh, Emma! Whoa, Emma!</div>
<div class="verse">That&#8217;s what I hear from Putney to Kew.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I asked them &#8220;what they meant?&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent">When some one at me sent</div>
<div class="verse">An egg, which nearly struck me in the eye.</div>
<div class="indent">The girl began to scream,</div>
<div class="verse">Saying, &#8220;Fred, what does this mean?&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent">I asked again, and this was their reply:</div>
<div class="indent3">Whoa, Emma! etc.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I thought they&#8217;d never cease,</div>
<div class="indent">So shouted out &#8220;Police!&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">And when he came he looked at me so sly</div>
<div class="indent">The crowd they then me chaffed,</div>
<div class="verse">And said &#8220;I must be daft,&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent">And once again they all commenced to cry:</div>
<div class="indent3">Whoa, Emma! etc.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>

<div class="verse">An old man said to me,</div>
<div class="indent">&#8220;Why, young man, can&#8217;t you see</div>
<div class="verse">The joke?&#8221; And I looked at him with surprise.</div>
<div class="indent">He said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be put out,</div>
<div class="verse">It&#8217;s a saying got about,&#8221;</div>
<div class="indent">And then their voices seemed to rend the skies:</div>
<div class="indent3">Whoa, Emma! etc.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>After a round of jokes and other buffoonery at
the expense of the ringmaster, who retorted with
threatening crackings of whip, he was ready with
more melody. Sometimes he appealed to the
tender emotions. &#8220;Baby Mine&#8221; was a favorite.
It ran thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>The clowns of the modern circus must needs
possess, they confidently assert, more vivacity,
wit and observation than their predecessors. The
magnitude of the spread of canvas almost entirely
precludes the possibility of effective oral utterance,
and their drollery is confined to gesture,
movement and posturing. This dumb acting
places the funmaker at a decided disadvantage,
and the problem of creations that will meet public
favor is one requiring unusual natural aptitude.
Frank Oakley (&#8220;Slivers&#8221;), fitted by nature for the
part, sprang into wonderful public favor in a
season.</p>

<p>In the grateful shade of the &#8220;big top,&#8221; during
the period between the two performances, I sat
one afternoon with an old-time performer whose
age keeps him from the ring, but the memory of
whose famous feats retains him in the employ of
the circus. The seductive fascination and charm
of the life has never dulled within him, and until
accumulated years finally forbid, he declares he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
will be a member of the organization. He was in
a reminiscent mood and began:</p>

<p>&#8220;In the old days I remember a feature of our
circus was Nettie Collins&#8217;s lilt &#8216;Dance me on Your
Knee.&#8217; The band played the flowing melody, and
she bowed and waved as she sang on a little
platform in the ring. It made a great hit for
several seasons. Here&#8217;s how its lines went, and
many an old-time circus goer will call them to
mind:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">When I was a little girl and full of childish joys</div>
<div class="verse">I used to play with all the girls, but oftener with the boys;</div>
<div class="verse">And with them climb the apple trees, and races, too, we&#8217;d run,</div>
<div class="verse">I&#8217;ll tell you, oh, &#8217;twas then, my boys, we had such jolly fun;</div>
<div class="verse">But now those days are past and gone, no more them I will see,</div>
<div class="verse">If I could only call them back, how happy I would be.</div>
<div class="indent6">You may dance me, darling, dance me,</div>
<div class="indent6">You may dance me on your knee.</div>
<div class="indent6">If there&#8217;s such a man among you</div>
<div class="indent6">As can recommend himself to me,</div>
<div class="indent6">Be sure he&#8217;s brave and strong enough</div>
<div class="indent6">To dance me on his knee.</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Then &#8216;Dick&#8217; Turner, comedian, in bucolic attire,
would stand up in a conspicuous place in the
reserved seats, gesticulate emphatically and shout:
&#8216;I&#8217;ll dance you on my knee, girl.&#8217; Most of the
audience would be deceived as to his identity,
supposing him to be a rural visitor to the show,
and there was great hilarity. &#8216;Come down here,
then,&#8217; the ringmaster would respond, and amid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
shrieks of laughter &#8216;Dick&#8217; would make his way to
the ring, where the fun continued. Oh, it was
easy to entertain in those simple old days!</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Al&#8217; Meaco was a favorite with his songs and
jokes. He was one of the first general clowns, and
did a drunken act on stilts that convulsed the
house, but was a hazardous performance, withal.
One of his idiotic stories which afforded great
amusement in the country districts was: &#8216;I&#8217;ve got
a beautiful girl. Went to see her the other night.
Met her on the woodshed. Oh, the tears I would
shed for her and the tears she would shed for me
would be shed more than the wood shed would
shed for me.&#8217; Then he did some fancy steps, the
band played and everybody laughed. What a
ghastly proceeding with the modern circus!</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Al&#8217; did an act with his brother &#8216;Tom&#8217; which
was considered a marvel then. &#8216;Al&#8217; swung head
down from a trapeze, attached his teeth to a
strap which belted his brother and whirled him in
circles. The act is an old one now and vastly
improved upon. I remember once &#8216;Al&#8217; forgot
himself, opened his mouth to speak to &#8216;Tom&#8217; and
the latter revolved forty feet through the air to
the earth below. He broke four ribs and a collar
bone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s another joke which one of our clowns
got off with success. Nowadays it would be received
with grief and shame. &#8216;I had a girl named
Sal Skinner. I called at her house one Sunday.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
She wasn&#8217;t home. Her mother said she&#8217;d gone to
church. I started out looking for her. Went into
the church and walked down the aisle, but didn&#8217;t
see her. The minister spotted me. &#8220;Are you
looking for salvation?&#8221; he says. &#8220;No,&#8221; I says,
&#8220;but I&#8217;m looking for Sal Skinner.&#8221;&#8217; The audience
howled with mirth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sam Lathrop used to make mock political
speeches, with flings at the politicians in the town
we were playing. The best received of his assortment
of jests was this one, given as the ring
horse halted: &#8216;Well, you stop, the horse stops, the
music stops, I stop, but there&#8217;s one thing nobody
can stop.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What is the one thing nobody can stop?&#8217;
followed the ringmaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why, a woman&#8217;s tongue!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The ringmaster, in apparent retaliatory discomfiture,
would crack his whip at the legs of the
clown, who uttered &#8216;Ouch!&#8217; as if in pain, and the
onlookers thought it all very funny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trained animals formed an important feature
of our programme, and we gave exhibitions which
have not been repeated since. One of our men
drove a troupe of buffaloes in tandem line around
the ring. &#8216;Grizzly&#8217; Adams had performing bears,
a dozen of them, and never was greater courage
required. Dick Sands put a herd of camels
through tricks and raced with a hippopotamus.
Dan Costello showed the full-blooded Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
bull, Don Juan; and John Hagenbeck taught a
company of zebras difficult paces. George Arstinstahl,
I think, was the first to group different
animals. He bunched elephants, bears, lions,
tigers and dogs before astonished audiences without
ever a suspicion of fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Three noted old-time circus riders, whose fame
was world-wide a few years ago, are members of
our organization this season, assisting the management.
They are &#8220;Bob&#8221; Stickney, whose equestrian
and acrobatic feats are still fresh in the
minds of all circus goers, and Frank J. Melville
and William E. Gorman, who were comfortable on
any part of a horse&#8217;s body, barring, perhaps, the
ears. They will live forever in the annals of the
circus. Timothy Turner was the first to somersault
on a horse&#8217;s back. The thing was done in
the old Bowery Theatre in New York City in the
&#8217;50&#8217;s. Levi J. North, who was performing in an
opposition theatre, heard of the accomplishment
and successfully imitated it the same night. John
Glenroy followed with a somersault&mdash;performed
without the presence of the pad then in general
use and which his predecessors had alighted upon.
Then James Robinson, creator of many bareback
tricks, duplicated the act. Charles Fish, Frank
Pastor, Romeo Sebastian and David Richards
were other celebrated circus horsemen of that
period. Billy Morgan inaugurated the now common
mule riding act.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>Mrs. Walter Howard was the first circus equestrienne
of public prominence. Sixty years ago, her
simple performance fairly dazed spectators. She
gave lessons in her art to many of the later
woman riders and made a sensation by being the
only woman at that time to cast herself through
paper balloons. Alice Lake was a remarkably
skilful horsewoman. Of the foreigners who came
here, Madame Tounaire was easily the best performer.
Her daughter, Molly Brown, was the first
woman in this country to somersault on a horse,
and few women since have accomplished the trick.
Mrs. William Roland, Madame Dockrill, Adelaide
Cordona, Louise Rentz, and Pauline Lee attained
prominence. Linda Jeal was famous for several
years and taught her niece, Dallie Julian, seventeen
years old, the somersault.</p>

CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>THE CIRCUS PRESS AGENT</small></h2></div>


<p>The wily press agent&#8217;s method of gaining publicity
for his show varies with the size and moral
disposition of the cities in which he finds himself.
In executing his publicity-provoking designs in
populous centres there is in him no serious purpose
to avoid an arrest. In the smaller cities he
must needs exercise his ingenuity to prevent the
action of the law. The notion that showmen are
moral delinquents is firmly settled in rural communities,
especially in the East, and if in the excess
of his enthusiasm to bring to wide attention the
presence of the circus the press agent commits
what an obdurate policeman considers a public
wrong, and there follows an appearance before a
magistrate, resentful townspeople look on him
and his companions as lawbreaking intruders,
rudely defying the local government, disturbing
the peace, and ready, perhaps, to commit some
more flagrant offence. A clergyman may make
the incident a text of protest. It is bound anyway
to arouse animosity and have a calamitous
effect.</p>

<p>But in New York, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and cities approaching them in character and size,
the standing of the circus is affected neither one
way nor the other by an ingenuously-explained
legal interruption, and the notice it attracts if it
has unusual features shows gratifyingly at the
box office. It isn&#8217;t always easy to accomplish the
thing. &#8220;Splash&#8221; Austin, whose first name, Paul,
was a boyhood memory, was the high diver with
one of the big circuses. He performed for the free
edification of the crowd which gathered on the lot
after the parade, which is the side-show harvest
time. Later he was one of the features of the
show itself. &#8220;Splash&#8221; was always at the press
agent&#8217;s service. The circus arrived in Chicago on
Sunday for a week stand, and the press agent was
ready with an elaborately planned venture. He
and his aquatic accomplice drove to Lincoln Park
bridge, where, by a coincidence which is not remarkable,
a band of newspaper men were in
waiting. The performer shed a few garments and
plunged headforemost from the railing&#8217;s height
into the water. The feat was a simple one to the
skilled acrobat, but its appearance was hazardous
and spectacular, and the reporters marvelled and
interviewed at length.</p>

<p>The beaming press agent&#8217;s ingenuity had not
been exhausted. Two frowning policemen intervened.
Their pockets, the press agent alone
knew, bulged with circus tickets. They were accommodatingly
indignant; the law had been violated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
&#8220;Splash&#8221; was put under arrest, and the
party started in a body for the station house.
On the way, the delighted author of the proceeding
secured permission from &#8220;Splash&#8217;s&#8221; captors to
stop at a drink dispensary. The bluecoats waited
outside while the circus man entertained. All
were thirsty and happy, and the newspaper guests,
in their innocence, cheerful over the unexpectedly
&#8220;good&#8221; story which had developed. They have
never known they tarried so long that one of
the policemen called their host outside and whispered
that there must be haste, two posts had
been left vacant too long already, and they were
half inclined to throw up the whole thing.</p>

<p>The day was eminently successful from the circus
standpoint. The newspapers told at great length
of the accomplishment of the daring dive and its
tragic ending, and the public curiosity to see the
performer added materially to receipts. And best
of all none of the reporters was so wanting in human
charity as to reveal that, at the police station,
the captain had refused to hold the prisoner,
remarking grimly that no offence had been committed;
and that the press agent, searching frantically
through the book of ordinances that his
scheme not miscarry at the end, had found that
a penalty attached to the crime of disturbing the
fish in the lake, and patient &#8220;Splash&#8221; was locked
up on that charge. A small fine was promptly
paid next day.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>Read one press agent&#8217;s circus literature and begin
to understand that the resources of the language
are less limited than you suppose. He is the
world-renowned alliterator of the show business.
He is better known in the profession than
Shakespeare, although Shakespeare never did
much for circuses. He has no acknowledged
rival in the successive use of the initial letter.
The advance matter which he sends abroad for
his &#8220;moral&#8221; enterprises where presumably only
moral people are admitted, forms an extraordinary
narrative.</p>

<p>During each winter he writes, writes, writes,
writes, whether he feels right or not, but the
annual incessant drain does not subtract from
his elaborate eloquence. He tells of &#8220;real and
royal races for reward, huge heroic hippodromes,
genuine contests of strength, skill and speed,
superb struggles for success and supremacy between
the short and the stout, the tall and the
tiny, the fat and the frail, the mammoth and the
midget, the adipose and the attenuate, the large
and the little, the massive and the minute, the
swift and the slow; elephants in ponderous, pachydermic
progress, camels in cross and comical cantering,
horses in hurricane hustling for home,
donkeys in deliberate, dragging, droning pace,
monkeys in merry meanderings on meek and mild
mules, whippets in whirlwind dashes swifter than a
horse, runners in record reducing running in rivalry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
ponies in carts with clowns for conductors,
and the celebrated charioteer contestants of the
Coliseum.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_236f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">FAIR EQUESTRIENNE ON HER FAVORITE HORSE.</p>

<p>Proceeding in his product, after this gaudy prologue,
this adjective-millionaire is impressed with
the &#8220;astral array of aerial artists. The very air
is filled with their flying forms, describing the
most intricate figures, far flights, swallow-like
sweeps, gymnic gyrations, castings and catches,
revolutions and returns, swings and somersaults,
leapings and lightnings, soarings and sailings,
altitudinous ascensions, diving descensions, keeping
the dizzy heights of the lofty canvas dome
alive with activity. Never before have the satiated
public seen a spectacle to so surely stir their
sluggish blood, arouse their admiration, excite
their enthusiasm and command their applause.&#8221;</p>

<p>The clowns appeal to him. As phrased by
him they are &#8220;a phenomenal phalanx of phantastical,
phuriously phunny phellows; silly and sedate,
short and stout, smile securers set scot
free; loyal legion of long and lean laugh liberators
let loose. These extraordinary experts in the creation
of laughter have invented this year a new,
novel, unique, irresistibly comic, excruciatingly
funny and simply surprising series of skits, scenes,
screaming sallies and silly situations.&#8221;</p>

<p>Danger is &#8220;defiantly defied by one audacious
aerial athlete, whose deed is daring, desperate
and death deriding, a fearless, fearful, fascinating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
feat, the veritable pinnacle of perillous performances.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whirling Wonders of the World on Wheels&#8221; are
&#8220;cycling champions in clubs and coteries, in single,
double and tandem teams, in wheeling fads, fancy
and freakish, in pictorial and picturesque peripatetic
posturings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Proceeding, he describes the elephants as
&#8220;mountains in motion, ponderous and perspicacious
pachyderms, in marvellous, military
manoeuvres.&#8221;</p>

<p>The districts remote from New York are assured
that &#8220;every element and entity that enthused,
excited and enthralled in the enormous Madison
Square Garden will be a part and parcel of the
prodigious performance.&#8221; And as a &#8220;super-splendid
spectacular suggestion of greater, grander
glories yet to come, early in the forenoon of the
day of exhibition there will pass through the
principal streets of the city the most mammoth,
monster mass of moving magnificence that ever
fell athwart the delighted, gratified, entranced
vision of the human eye, the nearly all new free
street parade, including an interesting and instructive
illustration of the progress of our glorious
Republic, showing in correct uniform the
soldiers of all American wars; gorgeous tableaux,
many massive, open dens, glittering cavalcades of
knights and ladies, representatives of the regiment
of Roosevelt&#8217;s Rough Riders, comic clowns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and grotesque grimaldis, rollicking rubes and
jolly jays, herds of ponderous elephants, droves of
camels, floods of music from military bands, etc.,
etc.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;Some circus owners never appreciate the valuable
services we render them,&#8221; lamented a veteran
press agent who has toured two continents under
a tent. &#8220;The ignominious end of my graveyard
specialty is an example of the palpable lack of
sentiment and business astuteness sometimes disclosed
when one least expects it. I observed that
almost every town has turned upon the public a
circus man of high or low degree, who finally returns
to his native spot to pass his last days and
be put away in the local cemetery. With the arrival
of the circus his career becomes a topic of
conversation among the townsfolk and invariably
newspaper reporter, hotel keeper or some other
resident engaged me in talk about the man. I
always unblushingly remembered him vividly and
was able, after a few leading questions, to shed
much entertaining light upon his circus life, to
express well-feigned surprise that the body of so
well-known a character was buried there and to
express a deep feeling of sorrow over the loss the
profession had sustained in his death. Sometimes
I would urge the erection of a more suitable
monument and reproach townspeople for
their neglect.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>&#8220;Not infrequently the subject of my solicitude
had been a four-horse driver, a trombone player
or a stake driver. But his professional insignificance
was not appreciated by the friends of his
life time, my tender expressions made good feelings
toward the show, and I let no opportunity
pass ungrasped. Sometimes the newspapers
quoted my sentiments, and it helped business.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had only been content with my own perfidious
eloquence I wouldn&#8217;t have got disgusted
and quit. But I was ambitious and wanted to
throw away no chance to boom the show. So,
soon, in every town in which I could locate an
appropriate headstone, I put on black clothes, a
countenance of becoming sadness and marched the
band to the graveyard. They played dirges all
the way. Frank Morris, the orator of the circus,
accompanied us and I had him make an address
at the grave. I wrote out three non-committal
speeches and there was no dead man whose life
didn&#8217;t fit one or judiciously selected parts of the
three. They were all very affecting, and made the
women cry. On the way back to the lot we always
got a loving ovation. The newspapers
spoke approvingly of the proceedings and the residents
thought it a great compliment. I was very
proud of myself.</p>

<p>&#8220;The thing went along swimmingly for several
weeks and my motives were never openly assailed,
although I think once or twice there lurked a suspicion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
in the minds of shrewd townspeople that
their departed brother wasn&#8217;t all in life that we
represented him. Anyway, I know it brought
money to the circus, and I could never understand
the boss&#8217;s secret disapproval. He never offered
any sensible, legitimate objection, but I could tell
by his manner that he was afraid of some kind of
a boomerang finish some day. I persevered aggressively,
nevertheless, and was confident he
would never get a valid excuse for forbidding us
to continue. I knew the experienced old man of
affairs was waiting warily for a chance.</p>

<p>&#8220;The success or failure of the concert depended
in a great measure upon Morris&#8217;s oratory. When
in good voice and spirits, he could fairly glue his
auditors to their seats. They wouldn&#8217;t budge
until they had seen all the concert attractions
about which he had so insinuatingly roared. So
it was through him that the boss found opportunity
to base a complaint, put an end to my
practices and lower my estimate of his business
intelligence. One unlucky day Morris caught a
bad cold. He was hoarse and depressed, and his
announcement was received with little favor. The
concert attendance was small and the head of the
show was quick to seize his advantage&mdash;and strike
at my burying-ground plot.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Morris got that cold in one of your graveyards,&#8217;
he addressed me, reproachfully, &#8216;and we&#8217;ll
have to give him a rest from this double duty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Let those fellows rest in peace in their graves
after this!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I left the show a month later, disgusted and
discouraged, and found a place where my fine art
received support and confidence and gratitude.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the Southern States several years ago a circus
now disorganized was in high popular favor, and
it was with great difficulty and at heavy expense
that the &#8220;big shows&#8221; of to-day succeeded in convincing
the population that its confidence had
been misplaced. Finally, however, they were welcomed
and accepted. The colored public was the
last to forsake its cherished tradition.</p>

<p>An advance press agent strolling past the flaring
billboards announcing the approach to an
Alabama town of the metropolitan organization
he represented, observed an aged, tottering darkey,
supported by a small boy of his race. They
were scrutinizing the posters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Read it to me, son,&#8221; directed the old man.
&#8220;What dey say about dis new circus?&#8221;</p>

<p>The lad stared ruefully at the polysyllabic collection
and began slowly: &#8220;Of all magnificent
and master consolidations of rare, varied and
illustrious menageries, circus and hippodrome
possessions and possibilities this is greatest.
Sept. 1, &mdash;&mdash;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s enough, my boy, dat&#8217;s enough,&#8221; interrupted
the attentive old listener, shaking his head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
grimly and chuckling, &#8220;&#8217;cept one, eh, &#8217;cept one.
I know dat one. It&#8217;s de circus I&#8217;s been seein&#8217; for
years. Dis false show don&#8217;t git none ob my
money.&#8221;</p>

<p>A free ticket, produced on the spot, helped to
shake his faith, but history does not record
whether the performance made him a thorough
convert.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Adam Forepaugh was as ready a man in an
emergency as circus life ever developed, and was
noted in the business for his skill in avoiding
legal entanglements. A resident of Auburn, N. Y.,
does not know to this day how neatly the showman
escaped a claim for damages at his expense.
The man had been drinking heavily, and in the
menagerie tent before the performance had begun
offered Bolivar, an elephant noted for his size, a
bottle filled with whiskey. The smell of the liquid
always infuriates the beasts. In the spring of
1902, Tops, a usually good-natured elephant,
stamped the life out of a man who offended her
with whiskey, in Brooklyn, N. Y. The Auburn
man was chased away unharmed by the watchful
keepers, but Bolivar&#8217;s small eyes gleamed vindictively
and he did not forget. The performance
was well under way, and the menagerie tent was
being rapidly emptied of its collection of animals
and cages, when the man returned. The elephants
and camels were lined up preparatory to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
march to the cars. The scene was one of confusion
and excitement, and the man was not observed
by the attendants. Bolivar, however, had
his eyes fixed on his persecutor and as the luckless
stranger came within reach the big beast trumpeted,
struck with his trunk and prepared to
stamp upon the victim. Keepers rushed to the
spot with pitchforks, subdued the angry elephant
and dragged the unconscious form away. An examination
showed no serious injury.</p>

<p>Visions of a sheriff, attachment and suit for
heavy damages oppressed Mr. Forepaugh at once,
but his quick wit suggested a way out of the
trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take this fellow to the cars,&#8221; he shouted to
&#8220;Dan&#8221; Taylor, boss canvasman, &#8220;and keep him
locked there. Don&#8217;t let him out when he gets his
senses again, but bring him to me in the morning
in Syracuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bruised and wondering man was taken like
a prisoner, according to instructions, before the
owner of the show next day. Mr. Forepaugh&#8217;s
attitude was that of a judge on the police court
bench. A withering frown was on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a nice specimen to hire out as a driver,&#8221;
he observed severely, &#8220;you were so drunk you fell
off the wagon. You are discharged. I can&#8217;t tolerate
intoxication with my circus. It&#8217;s fortunate
you were not killed and the horses didn&#8217;t run
away.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>The effects of drink and the blow he received had
driven memory from the unfortunate man&#8217;s brain,
and as Mr. Forepaugh perceived it a load was
lifted from him. He talked kindly but firmly to
the penitent before him, dwelt on the evils of intemperance
and finally offered him a day&#8217;s pay if
he would promise not to drink liquor for a year.
The pledge was solemnly given and, I have been
told, the man was ever after consecrated to sobriety.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A good story is told by a former press agent of
one of the big circuses of how Samuel D. Clemens
(Mark Twain) was out-humored at his home in
Hartford, Conn., by an untutored savage. The
enterprising agent decided it would be a good advertisement
to get an interview between Mr.
Clemens and one of the Indians who were then a
feature of the show. He called on the humorist
and laid the matter before him. Mr. Clemens
said that he didn&#8217;t care for the Indians, he was
very busy, and didn&#8217;t see what Indians had to do
with him, anyway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the fact is,&#8221; replied the circus man,
&#8220;they have heard of you in the far West and
want to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still Mr. Clemens was indisposed to grant the
request until the press agent swore solemnly that
a big Sioux Chief had said that he would never
die happy, if compelled to return to his reservation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
without seeing and speaking with the man
whose fame was world-wide.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; finally assented the humorist.
&#8220;Have him here at six o&#8217;clock this evening, but
make it short.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Clemens sat on the broad porch of his
home in Farmington avenue at the appointed
time. The house was a fine, long, rambling red
brick structure standing near the top of a green
breezy hill. To the astonishment of the man he
perceived an immense cavalcade of mounted warriors,
more than half a hundred of them, tearing
along the broad, airy boulevard in a mad exhibition
of horsemanship. They swept in on the
lawn, breaking down the shrubbery, wearing off
the grass and devastating the whole place like a
destroying army. A crowd of boys were at their
heels, trampling flower beds and shrubs. The
spokesman of the party was a mighty hunter who
had been previously told that Mark Twain was
famous for his slaughter of wild beasts.</p>

<p>The Indian laid himself out for a game of brag.
The interpreter, who was in the deal, instead of
repeating what the chief said, made a speech of
his own, extolling Twain&#8217;s literary achievements.</p>

<p>&#8220;For Heaven&#8217;s sake, choke him off!&#8221; ejaculated
the sad funny-man, with blanched face. The
cracking of boughs in the choice trees in which the
small boys had ensconced themselves were punctuating
the Indian&#8217;s remarks.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>The interpreter turned to the red man and soberly
remarked that the White Hunter wanted more
talk, and on he went. Every time Twain cried for
quarter the chief was told to give another hunting
story. Finally his Indian vocabulary was exhausted
and he quit.</p>

<p>Twain made a brief reply which the interpreter
translated into a marvellous hunting yarn. The
Chief listened stolidly, and when he got away
grunted contemptuously and muttered:</p>

<p>&#8220;White man heap big liar.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Adam Forepaugh, in the latter years of his circus
life, carried with his show a &#8220;Wild West&#8221; department.
He had Indians, cowboys, Mexicans,
Cossacks, Arabs, scouts, guides, detachments of
regular soldiers from the armies of several nations
and all the others that go to make a spectacular
rough-riding production. I remember an amusing
incident which illustrates that the veteran tented-amusement
purveyor did not allow sentiment to
interfere with the ticket wagon end of the business.
One of the features of the exhibition was a representation
of Custer&#8217;s disastrous battle with the
Sioux Indians under Sitting Bull. The <i>mise en scne</i>
was correct in most particulars, and carried out
with fidelity to the subject. It was a graphic illustration
of the Indian mode of warfare. The cowboys
who participated were true children of the
plains who had faced danger in many of its deadliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
forms. They were very proud of their records
as scouts, plainsmen and warriors.</p>

<p>Along about the middle of the season Mr. Forepaugh
picked up a famous addition to the show
in Mt. Vernon, O. He was Sergeant George C.
Wagner, &#8220;representative frontiersman of the past.&#8221;
He came unannounced, looking for a job in the
Wild West department, hopping on to the lot like
a clumsy bird. A wooden prop replaced the flesh
and bone of his right leg below the knee. He explained
to Mr. Forepaugh that he was the sole
survivor of Custer&#8217;s immediate command; he had
escaped death in the last rally, because at the
time of the fight he was riding the plains with a
message to Major Reno, seventy-two miles away.
During his lonely journey he had encountered
Indians, and a poisoned arrow received in the
running conflict had necessitated amputation of
his leg. He looked the figure of romance and adventure,
impressed the circus owner as sincere and
was hired on the spot.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_248f.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">ACROBATS PRACTISING NEW FEATS.</p>

<p>As the days went by the sergeant became more
and more a conspicuous part of the show. He
was a skilful horseman, despite his abbreviated
limb, although we all wondered how he was able to
hold his seat. His name appeared in black type
on the programme, and he always got a tremendous
ovation when he scurried on a big bay horse
around the hippodrome amid the blare of trumpets,
after a highly complimentary introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
by the announcer. After the show, Grand Army
posts frequently gave him informal receptions, at
which he regaled the veterans with thrilling stories
of life on the trail and of incidents of the excitement
and turmoil of the unsettled West. He drank
whiskey with great freedom and frequency, but it
seemed to affect only his tongue. His encounters
with red men then became innumerable and his
life history was written all over with blood. His
knowledge of Custer&#8217;s campaigns was comprehensive
to a detail.</p>

<p>Mr. Forepaugh was mightily pleased with the
acquisition, but not so the cowboys, the true sons
of the frontier. All the honors of the show were
Wagner&#8217;s and they were jealous. One day one of
them suggested a systematic review of their gallant
comrade&#8217;s past in the hope of uncovering an
act of cowardice or crime, and the proposition
met general favor. They hired a lawyer to investigate
and his report was received in a surprisingly
short time. The man who had represented
himself as cradled amid pioneer surroundings
had never been out of the Ohio county in
which he revealed himself until the circus adopted
him, and he had lost his leg by a premature
anvil explosion at a Fourth of July celebration.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that Adam Forepaugh
lost, in a great measure, the respect and admiration
of the cowboy fraternity, and proved, as I
have observed, that noble emotions and lofty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
ideals cannot always rise supreme in the circus
business. The cowboys, with many strange oaths
and threats, presented their damning narrative,
confident that the hour of retribution was at
hand and that the owner of the show would express
sympathy and gratitude for the disclosure.
Wagner, they thought, would be clubbed off the lot.</p>

<p>Mr. Forepaugh listened intently to the story of
the imposition. He, too, I know, had been as
thoroughly deceived as the rest of us, but he
wasn&#8217;t willing the show should suffer.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do I care,&#8221; he remarked quickly, and the
expectant faces of the cowboys blanched, &#8220;whether
the fellow&#8217;s a fakir or not? He looks the part
better than any of you, he&#8217;s got a wooden leg to
confirm it, he&#8217;s the finest liar under the tent and
he&#8217;s made a big hit. He stays with the troupe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sergeant&#8221; Wagner continued as hero, guide,
and scout until the season&#8217;s close, when he disappeared
and the Wild West department heard of
him no more. The memory of his dare-devil appearance,
long golden locks floating in the wind,
wide sombrero, buckskin breeches and protruding
guns will not be effaced for many years.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The gnawing fear of attachments is never absent
from the circus owner&#8217;s mind, and with all his
mental wealth of resource, acquired by hard experience,
he cannot always escape imposition. The
sheriff becomes an object of hate and dread. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
appearance with a levy, the showman knows, is
a portend of extortion. So it is that sometimes
he submits to injustice rather than bring
about a conflict with the law. Unscrupulous people
appreciate this, with its fine opportunity for
blackmail, but sometimes the instigator comes as
a shock and a surprise to the circus owner and
helps to shake his faith in the general honest impulses
accredited to human nature.</p>

<p>We were playing the Ohio towns. Business was
big, weather fine and everybody was happy. One
day a negro preacher, hat in hand and apologetic
in manner, approached the owner and explained a
grievance. His church edifice, eight miles outside
the town, had been posted with our glaring show
bills, the congregation was angry and mortified
and threatening to go over in a body to another
parish, and the church receipts had fallen to
nothing. One hundred dollars would set things
right. A lawyer who fingered a bunch of legal
papers ominously was with the outraged clergyman.
The circus compromised for fifty dollars
and got a release.</p>

<p>We showed next day in a town fourteen miles
distant. Before the parade had formed, the colored
minister of the day before again confronted us.
He was humble and devout enough in appearance,
but the same lawyer was his companion, and
a man whom we knew was the sheriff hovered on
the outskirts of the lot. The man of religion lamented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
his complaint of the preceding day without
a variation, and concluded the narrative
again with a demand for pecuniary balm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I settled with you yesterday,&#8221; the astonished
owner retorted. &#8220;I gave you fifty dollars,
and hold your paper of satisfaction. You have
no further claim.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Mr. Circus man,&#8221; was the ready answer,
&#8220;my church is on the county line. Yesterday
you paid for desecrating the house of God in
Lorain county. But you also profaned our sacred
worshipping place in Cuyahoga county. I want
damages now for the actual and religious injury
done there.&#8221;</p>

<p>If we hadn&#8217;t been so prosperous, I know the
owner wouldn&#8217;t have yielded. As it was, the unblushing
effrontery of the thing appealed to his
sense of humor, and he gave the man another
fifty dollars. He told of the proceeding at dinner
as a good joke at his expense, and remarked that,
after all, he was not sorry to have had the chance
to contribute to the finances of the struggling
congregation. It might bring him good luck.</p>

<p>About three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon he told me
to ascertain the whereabouts of the church&mdash;he
had become curious about the shrewd preacher&#8217;s
affairs&mdash;and we would drive out there. The church
was about six miles away, through a lonely country
district. We lost our way once and the circus
owner was not in the best of humor when we arrived.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
The sight that greeted him knocked out all
the exalted sentiment that had stirred him. The
steeple of the building was on a level with the
eaves, two cows browsed off the pulpit, there was
evidence of the nocturnal presence of hens in the
amen corner, and the whole edifice was in a state
of dilapidation and decay. Along the entire front
was an inch and a half accumulation of circus
bills. Ours were the outside strata. The minister
couldn&#8217;t be found, fortunately for his physical
welfare. He was probably spending his booty.
His wife told us the congregation had dissolved
months ago, and our adroit questioning disclosed
that the couple&#8217;s income consisted in a great measure
of the money extracted from the circuses who,
innocently, utilized the inviting stretch of ecclesiastical
boards. The memory of the colored clergyman
is still green with the circus man, and religion
is at a discount with the show.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>P. T. Barnum, in the early years of his life, had
no modern press agent, but it is doubtful if the
interesting person could have aided the showman
in advertising his enterprises. No one knew better
than he the value of printer&#8217;s ink, and of the
men who made printer&#8217;s ink the vehicle of
news and information. Old circus men recall an
illustration of his unique but impressive way of
attracting public attention in 1849, which would
have done credit to this enlightened generation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
He sent an expedition to Ceylon, a formidable
undertaking then, to capture elephants. They returned
to New York with ten of the animals,
harnessed them in pairs to a chariot and drove up
Broadway. Not content with this advertisement,
he sent one of the elephants to his Connecticut
farm and engaged the beast in agricultural pursuits.
A keeper, clad in oriental costume, was the
companion. They were stationed on a six-acre lot
which lay close beside the tracks of the New York
and New Haven railroad. The keeper was furnished
with a timetable of the road with special
instructions to be busily engaged in plowing, with
the animal dragging the implement, whenever
passenger trains passed. The proceeding made a
sensation and the showman gravely announced
that he intended to introduce a herd of elephants
to do all his plowing and heavy draft work. After
the six acres had been plowed over at least a hundred
times, he quietly returned the animal to his
museum.</p>

<p>It is related in the circus world that the &#8220;Feejee
Mermaid&#8221; was the stepping-stone to Barnum&#8217;s
road to wealth and circus renown. The thing was
made in Japan with an ingenuity and mechanical
perfection well calculated to deceive. Barnum
bought it in 1842, when he was unknown, modified
by printer&#8217;s ink the general incredulity as to
the possibility of the existence of mermaids, and
aroused great curiosity to see and examine his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
specimen. Then, too, he persuaded some naturalist
to endorse it as genuine. The fame of his
museum and its preserved curiosity was wafted
from one end of the land to the other. Money
flowed in rapidly and the notoriety he attained he
never permitted to fade.</p>

<p>In the museum, the ladder by which he rose to
fortune, Mr. Barnum a few months later perpetrated
another humbug which arrested public attention.
He purchased in Cincinnati, O., a well-formed,
small-sized horse, with no mane and not
a particle of hair on his tail, while his body and
legs were covered with thick, fine hair or wool,
which curled tight to his skin. The animal had
been foaled in Ohio and was a remarkable freak
of nature. The astute showman immediately advertised
the beast as &#8220;The Woolly Horse.&#8221; The
news had just come that Colonel John C. Fremont,
who was supposed to have been lost in the
snows of the Rocky Mountains, was in safety.
Mr. Barnum grasped the opportunity and asserted
that his horse had been captured by the explorer&#8217;s
party. The curiosity was a great attraction
for many months, and no definite exposure of the
imposition was ever made. It added immeasurably
to the reputation and pecuniary success of
the establishment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The circus press agent is a welcome visitor to
the country newspaper office. In his gratitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
over the influx of tickets and advertising, the
editor generally devotes space to a eulogy of the
social and professional merits of the visitor. Here
are some truthfully reproduced specimens, taken at
random from a collection:</p>

<p>&#8220;The bustling press agent of the vast concourse
is the most popular man with the circus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The press agent is built for a gentleman from
the ground up, and he acts it with the ease and
dignity of a Chesterfield.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The management is fortunate in having for its
press representative &mdash;&mdash;, who is a gentleman in
every way, and who understands his business
thoroughly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The press agent is one of the most genial gentlemen
in the profession, and he is much liked by
the newspapers wherever he goes, not only because
he is liberal with the pasteboards, but because he
is a hale fellow well met.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash; leaves nothing undone on his part to
make the grand show popular.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;&mdash; is a mighty clever gentleman. He called
at our office to-day and made himself agreeable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The press agent of the circus is undoubtedly
an element of strength in that big institution. He
is a mighty pleasant gentleman and knows exactly
how to make himself popular with the
newspaper men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is the right man in the right place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The show has four aces in &mdash;&mdash;, the press representative,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
who is such a thorough gentleman
that his kindness to the press boys issues his own
patent to nobility.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The press agent treated us nicely yesterday.
Several little attentions he gave us made us feel
more than kind to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The circus is lucky in having him for press
agent. He is a refined and courteous gentleman
to whom much is due for the success and popularity
of this great show.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The press of this section will always welcome
the coming of this genial gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But probably the most versatile artist of this
great aggregation was &mdash;&mdash;, the press agent of
this enormous aggregation. He deserves special
mention.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On last Thursday evening of the circus, the
editor of the &mdash;&mdash;, upon invitation of the pleasing
and wide awake press agent, went &#8216;behind the
scenes&#8217; on a tour of the dressing-rooms of the
great institution. We were first introduced to the
great and only &mdash;&mdash;, just preparing to mount the
twenty-three bareback horses, which he rides to
the consternation of all who see him. Going to
the left, the curtain was raised and Trunktown
was seen, that is, about one hundred and fifty
people sitting upon, diving into, standing or beside
their trunks, in various stages of deshabille,
preparing for their various acts. Taking off his
plug, the press agent announced the presence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
the editor, and everybody came forward and
shook us by the hand&mdash;for a little while we
thought we were running for President of the
United States. A chair was brought for us and a
little chat indulged in with those near, among
whom was the great bareback rider. We had a
chat with the gladiators, also, who were making
up for their act, one of the most pleasing and artistic
of the show. In shaking hands with those
chaps we got some white powder on our left
shoulder, which they use to powder their faces.
After returning to our wife in the circus auditorium,
we had great difficulty in explaining the
powder away. But the press agent bore testimony
that we had not visited the ladies&#8217; dressing-rooms,
not being the right gender.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An old-time press agent, writing a brief list of a
few men met with in the circus&#8217;s transitory career
and who will continue to exist when showmen of
this generation have passed on, mentions:</p>

<p>The man who travelled with Dan Rice.</p>

<p>The man who when a boy carried water for the
elephant.</p>

<p>The man who knew the man who sold his cook
stove to secure the price of a circus ticket.</p>

<p>The man who knows how many thousands of
dollars the circus takes out of town.</p>

<p>The man who is anxious to know when &#8220;show
folks&#8221; sleep.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>The man who sympathizes with us because of
our &#8220;hard life.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man who asks: &#8220;Where do you go from
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man who knows the show is &#8220;split up&#8221; in
the smaller towns.</p>

<p>The man who is sure &#8220;this is the best show
town of its size in the United States.&#8221;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
